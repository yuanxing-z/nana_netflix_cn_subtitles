1
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:08,049
Without even exchanging
a single word with Takumi,

2
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:11,511
I kissed him all the way to my bed.

3
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:15,598
That was when I sensed
Nana leaving the apartment.

4
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:21,104
In the back of my head,
which at the time had a severed circuit,

5
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:25,400
I thought to myself that
she must’ve gone to see Ren.

6
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:54,345
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

7
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,171
Hey Nobu, let’s go home already.

8
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,757
I’ll pay for the taxi.

9
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,719
If you wanna go, then just go.

10
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,096
Let me stay at your place.

11
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,931
Go to one of your women.

12
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,683
I’m not in the mood for that.

13
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,893
That Takumi is so annoying.

14
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,396
Hachi is our pet.
How dare he steal her away.

15
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,564
Don’t talk about her as if she’s a dog.

16
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:31,568
But doesn’t it piss you off?
Get her back, Nobu.

17
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,862
You like Hachi, don’t you?

18
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,991
-It’s impossible.
-You coward.

19
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,327
There’s nothing I can do about it!
Hachi likes him.

20
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,246
But that’s just as a fan, right?

21
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,623
It might’ve started off like that,

22
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,960
but once she actually met him,
she’s become serious about him!

23
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,796
Otherwise,
she wouldn’t have gone off with him.

24
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,340
But it was the day after they met, right?

25
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,217
Would she become serious so quickly?

26
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:00,138
I think it was no more than just being
in the heat of the moment.

27
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,724
Do you realize what you’re saying?

28
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,642
Hachi isn’t that kinda woman!

29
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,728
I just know that Takumi
cleverly worked his charm on her,

30
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,605
and Hachi fell for it.

31
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,690
He deceived her.

32
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:14,736
Are you sure?
I don’t think Hachi’s that stupid.

33
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,821
It’s not about how stupid she is.

34
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,490
She’s naive! And she’s way too honest!

35
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,535
I know that, but you know,

36
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,872
I noticed how you were disappointed
about Reira after meeting her.

37
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,792
Aren’t you idealizing women
a bit too much?

38
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,629
Do you think that women
don’t have sexual desires?

39
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:36,049
I’m talking about Hachi right now!

40
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,052
Don’t you dare group her together
with the easy women looking after you!

41
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,595
I don’t necessarily think

42
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:44,265
that the women wanting to sleep
with me are easy.

43
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,144
I do think they’re shallow though.

44
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,271
They’re all just lonely.

45
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,483
In Hachi’s case, don’t you think that
maybe she was lonely too,

46
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,817
after her break-up with her boyfriend?

47
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:02,075
But you hesitated to take action,
so Takumi ended up taking her.

48
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,912
It may very well have happened
in the heat of the moment,

49
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,288
but knowing Hachi,

50
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,332
she may become more
and more serious about him.

51
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,710
But if Takumi continues treating
this relationship in that manner,

52
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,338
Hachi is obviously gonna get hurt.

53
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:20,468
Are you okay with that, Nobu?
I don’t like it one bit.

54
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,394
You know, it’s a bit surprising.

55
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,857
No matter how I look at it,
your actions are just as bad as Takumi’s,

56
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,193
so you’re not in any position
to talk that way about him.

57
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,029
But for you to do so
shows how fond you are of Hachi.

58
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,781
Hachi’s the pup who's fond of me.

59
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,199
Stop talking about her
as if she's some dog.

60
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,203
You know, all the women I know want me,

61
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,206
whether it’s my body or my heart.

62
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,333
But with Hachi, she’s just kind to me

63
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,877
without expecting anything
from me in return.

64
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,463
I really feel a sense of love.

65
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,760
But when you fall in love,

66
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,472
it’s human nature to want everything
about that person for yourself.

67
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,141
Is that so?

68
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,895
If you want her, go for it.

69
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,606
Well, I do believe that,
like you just said,

70
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:21,237
real love is expressed
by looking after the one you love…

71
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,282
without expecting… anything in return…

72
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:30,288
But I can’t take this.
I cannot forgive that guy!

73
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:37,545
I can feel true love from you, Nobu.

74
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,302
Sir! Your change!

75
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,806
Welcome! Table for one?

76
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,145
What’s the matter?

77
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,278
Sorry. It’s not important.

78
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,114
Just tell me!
What time do you think it is?

79
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,157
It’s four in the morning!

80
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,078
You can’t hold back now
after calling me out at this hour.

81
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,413
Coffee.

82
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,831
Certainly.

83
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,917
What about you? A café au lait?

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,877
I-- I’m fine.

85
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:22,048
Order something.
I’ll treat if you’re short on cash.

86
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,007
Are you hungry?

87
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:28,012
To be honest, I was worried
because I have no money.

88
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,390
How much do you need?
I don’t have a lot on me though.

89
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,809
No, it’s not that!

90
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,019
I forgot my wallet.

91
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,981
I realized I didn’t have it with me
after I sat down in the restaurant.

92
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,316
So I called you to save me.

93
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,028
Don’t laugh!

94
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,405
So that’s all it was?

95
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,950
Then why didn’t you say so
in the first place?

96
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,912
You said "help" with such a stern voice.

97
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:53,996
You had me wondering.

98
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,415
I said I’m sorry.

99
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,000
It’s okay. I’m relieved.

100
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,254
I’m relieved that it wasn’t
something more serious.

101
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,720
Anyway, order something.

102
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:14,642
What are you hesitating for?
It’s not like you.

103
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,520
They have cake. Strawberry cake. Order it.

104
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:28,156
But what are you doing drinking tea
here alone at this time of night,

105
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,074
this close to your home?

106
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:37,248
Something did happen, right?
Did you have a fight with Nana?

107
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,881
Takumi is at our place.

108
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,844
I didn’t wanna get in their way.

109
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:03,065
When I look at these things,
it really doesn’t seem like me.

110
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,444
Do I really look like this?

111
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,032
Sorry, were you sleeping?

112
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,409
You fall asleep right after sex,
don’t you?

113
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,162
You fell asleep quickly
the last time, too.

114
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,665
I wasn’t really asleep the last time.

115
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,418
I was faking it because I was sad
that you were so quick to leave.

116
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,255
But now, I know you’ll stay
with me when you have the time.

117
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,676
What did you just say?

118
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,179
I said you were holding back
the last time,

119
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,931
but today, you were amazing.

120
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,644
-Who taught you?
-No one!

121
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,103
I’m kinda jealous.

122
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,273
There’s not one thing about me
that you should be jealous about!

123
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,399
Don’t you have a boyfriend?

124
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:50,238
That's not a question
you’d normally ask in this situation.

125
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,198
No, I don't.

126
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,159
Really? I’m glad.

127
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,661
He’s glad?

128
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,706
But you’re cute,
so I’ll bet you’re popular with the guys.

129
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,043
No way. I’m not at all popular.

130
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,211
You’re the popular one, Mr. Takumi.

131
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,587
Please, drop the "Mr.".

132
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:12,093
T-- Takumi, you’re popular with women,
so you must have many girlfriends.

133
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,179
No, no luck there. Not at all.

134
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,180
No way.

135
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,558
I may be stupid,
but not stupid enough to fall for that.

136
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,475
Huh?

137
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,477
There’s no way
you’re not popular with girls.

138
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,273
No. I really am no good.
I lead such a lonely life.

139
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,607
There’s just no way!

140
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,318
The fact is, I give my work priority

141
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,196
and end up not paying enough
attention to any woman.

142
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,490
I’m not one to answer emails promptly,

143
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,076
and I’m often unable
to keep promises I make.

144
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,663
So I have never been
in a long-term relationship.

145
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,664
Every once in a while,
when I get some time off,

146
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,834
I’ll contact a girl from the past
only to have her coldly tell me,

147
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,502
"I’m not interested in you."

148
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,754
What a waste!

149
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,966
But you can’t help it with you
being so busy with your work.

150
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:56,178
You’re the only one who’s said
anything so understanding, Nana.

151
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,930
That’s because,
although I’m a fan of yours,

152
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,600
I’m a fan of Trapnest first and foremost.

153
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,476
I am counting on you
to continue to work hard

154
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,811
and produce new tunes.

155
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,316
You’re really cute.

156
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,423
Nana…

157
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,427
I don’t wanna give you up to anyone.

158
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,930
Be mine forever.

159
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,527
So Takumi’s there. What for?

160
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,613
He came to do it with her.

161
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,865
He arrives, and next thing,
they’re making out in the doorway.

162
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,575
Hachiko is in tears.

163
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,578
What the hell? When did this happen?

164
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,496
I don’t know.

165
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,748
There’s no way you couldn’t have known.

166
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,583
When I say I don’t know,
I mean I don’t know!

167
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,837
But what’s wrong with that?

168
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,548
Hachiko is free to go out
with whoever she wants.

169
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:18,094
But I have a problem
with letting her date Takumi.

170
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,263
He has always been such a womanizer.

171
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,516
But if she’s in love with him,
it can’t be helped!

172
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,810
A woman’s happiness is to be
in the arms of the man she loves,

173
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,853
regardless of what kind of person he is!

174
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,522
She’ll have no regrets,
no matter how badly she gets hurt!

175
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,067
That may be true for you, but…

176
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,986
Besides, given Hachiko’s cuteness,

177
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,948
Takumi may end up falling
head over heels for Nana!

178
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,991
Just like how Ren fell for me.

179
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,996
There’s always a small chance
that will happen, but…

180
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,291
Anyway, I’m on Hachi’s side.

181
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,459
I really was thinking

182
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,002
how great it would be
if she found a boyfriend.

183
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,712
On top of that,
if this boyfriend is Takumi,

184
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,381
whom she’s always adored, all the better.

185
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,551
I wanna cheer her on as a friend.

186
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,761
But…

187
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,765
Why did it have to be
Takumi of all people?

188
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,311
What you are saying
isn’t making any sense.

189
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,729
Besides, aren’t you the one

190
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,149
who set up the meeting
between Takumi and Nana?

191
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,900
I know that.

192
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,446
But I never imagined
that it would end up like this!

193
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,407
Yeah. You never knew
about the terrible things

194
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,658
Takumi has been known to do.

195
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,327
Come on! I could care less
about the terrible things

196
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,121
Takumi has been known to do!

197
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,665
Then what do you not like about this?

198
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:38,674
Why does Trapnest continue to take away
the things I hold most dear to me?

199
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:46,849
But it’s not as if either Ren
or Hachiko belong to me.

200
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,519
I realize it’s not right to think
in those terms.

201
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,690
No matter if we’re always together,
each one of us is living a different life.

202
00:12:55,316 --> 00:13:00,696
I know it’s impossible to try
and make someone yours.

203
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,616
But there are times

204
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:07,745
when it makes me so lonely,
it’s unbearable.

205
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:16,212
Maybe I was in fact thinking
of Hachiko as my pet dog.

206
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,506
I’m the worst.

207
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,692
I’m gonna catch a cab
and go straight to the office now.

208
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,236
Come with me.

209
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,947
You can continue this discussion with Ren.

210
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,156
INCOMING MAIL
REN

211
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,742
THE PARTY IS OVER.
I’LL BE AT HOME WAITING FOR YOU.

212
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,744
TOKYO TAXI

213
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,746
Sorry, Yasu.

214
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:55,000
I keep taking advantage
of your kindness, don’t I?

215
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,752
I realize it, but…

216
00:13:56,835 --> 00:14:00,756
If you do, then I wish
you'd grow up already.

217
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,384
As long as you keep calling me out
at this hour,

218
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,760
I’m never gonna find a girlfriend.

219
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:10,432
I’ll try to grow up
before you get back with Reira.

220
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,269
Why should I have to get
back together with Reira?

221
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:17,106
Because my fate is
to have everyone I hold dear

222
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,860
taken away by the members of Trapnest.

223
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,279
Then the same goes for me too.

224
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:28,200
The woman I was dating left me
to go to Tokyo with Trapnest,

225
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,244
my best friend was recruited to join them,

226
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:35,624
and on top of that, our vocalist
is Trapnest’s guitarist’s girl.

227
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,586
You’re right!

228
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,839
Why am I being all cheerful about
seeing the guitarist of our biggest enemy

229
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,173
this early in the morning?

230
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:47,845
Cheerful? That’s good to hear.

231
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,014
-Maybe I should go home.
-Go and see him.

232
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,267
Damn! Why is this happening?

233
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,728
This must be what Hachi means
when she talks about the Demon Lord!

234
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,732
Or it’s more like Trapnest is
an army of Demon Lords.

235
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,735
You and Ren are really alike.

236
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,197
I just remembered

237
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,491
how Ren told me something similar
to what you just said,

238
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,118
before he left for Tokyo.

239
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,500
That in the end, we are all alone.

240
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,922
No matter how hard you try to be close
to someone, you cannot become one,

241
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,884
and it’s impossible
to make someone belong to you.

242
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,557
I know that it’s impossible.

243
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:41,482
But sometimes I really strongly wish
that Nana belonged only to me.

244
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,110
Then I could put her in the pocket
of my leather jacket

245
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,363
and take her to Tokyo with me.

246
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,490
No, she wouldn’t fit in there.

247
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:55,746
Why not just tell her that you
want her to come with you?

248
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,750
That sounds cool! I’ll give it a try.

249
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,128
Yeah, do it.

250
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,602
You can live your life however you like.

251
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,909
There’s a sea in Tokyo too.
I had forgotten.

252
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,579
Nice view, isn’t it?
Wanna live here with me?

253
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,626
I’ll think about it.

254
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,091
That day,

255
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:54,013
Takumi ate most of the leftovers
from the night before.

256
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:02,104
Then right after noon, he told me
he had work to do and left.

257
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,070
I was restless,

258
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:14,616
wanting to tell Nana everything
that happened as soon as possible,

259
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,870
before this feeling of happiness
had a chance to cool down.

260
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:26,670
Nana’s late.
She said she had no plans today.

261
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,630
Is she still at Ren’s place? I wonder.

262
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,135
But if Takumi has work today,
then so does Ren.

263
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,139
Even on our days off,
we have things to do.

264
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,642
I’m sorry. I’ll call you later.

265
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,105
I wonder, does he really have to work?

266
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,484
No, I’ll believe him.

267
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,820
I’m not like those other women.
I’m gonna understand him.

268
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,322
MESSAGE NANA

269
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,744
To Nana. What time will you
be coming home?

270
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,954
There are many things
I wanna talk to you about.

271
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:01,914
WHAT TIME WILL YOU
BE COMING HOME?

272
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:02,915
THERE ARE MANY THINGS
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

273
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,919
You’re home!

274
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,927
I’m home… Wow, that has a nice ring to it.

275
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:19,181
Sorry, sorry. It’s you, Nobu.
I thought it was Nana.

276
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,726
Ah, Nana’s not here?

277
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,647
-No, I think she’s at Ren’s place.
-I see.

278
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,982
Sorry. Anyway, come in.

279
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,152
I was just writing Nana an email,

280
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,529
but why don’t we give her a call instead?

281
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:38,033
Ah, no. I didn’t come here
to see Nana. It’s you, Hachi.

282
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,746
-Er, Nana. I need to talk to you.
-To me?

283
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,375
I’m fine! I’m not gonna rely
on the power of alcohol.

284
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,128
What’s the matter?

285
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,965
Did something happen?

286
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,731
-I can’t.
-Can’t what?

287
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,483
-I’ll be back again!
-What the…

288
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,694
There’s not a single thing
I’m superior in.

289
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,195
It’s impossible.
I can’t compete against him.

290
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,240
What are you talking about?
Let me help you!

291
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,200
But… I promise you, one day,
I’ll be better than him.

292
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,786
-Than who?
-Takumi.

293
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,680
You have two messages.

294
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:48,353
Yasu! It’s me, Naoki!
I also left a message on your cell!

295
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,648
I wanna see you while I’m off,
so could you make some time for me?

296
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:55,194
I’ll invite Reira, too! See ya later!

297
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,864
What is it with everyone?

298
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,658
This is Kawano of Gaia Records.

299
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:06,163
I had a chance to review the demo tape
and live video you sent us.

300
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,332
I would be interested in talking with you.

301
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,176
Are you serious about this?

302
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,682
That comes out to 1,215 yen.

303
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,352
Oh, Nana, I’ll take care of that.

304
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,686
It’s okay. They’re my things.

305
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,362
Then I’ll get this, too.

306
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,450
Hey, Nana.

307
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,706
We were always together,
yet I didn’t understand you one bit.

308
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:57,172
Forgive me for not realizing that
I had been hurting you.
