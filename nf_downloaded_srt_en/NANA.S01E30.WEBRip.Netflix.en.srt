1
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:08,675
I'm still calling your name, Nana…

2
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,011
no matter how much it hurts…

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,265
until you answer me.

4
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,771
I’m sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

5
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,442
You may not remember this,

6
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:31,781
but I was serious about building
that nice house with a big yard.

7
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,036
It would be on a hill
where we could see the ocean,

8
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,164
complete with a state-of-the-art
system kitchen and basement studio.

9
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,876
In your closet would be

10
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,670
a whole line of clothes
of the latest fashion,

11
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:50,049
so that you’d have a smile
on your face every time you came home,

12
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,595
even with your tendency
to have your heart broken by men.

13
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,915
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

14
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,202
One way ticket to Tokyo.

15
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,621
The trains are running late
because of the snow.

16
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,248
Anything will do
as long as it gets me there.

17
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,632
EXIT

18
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,679
SMOKING AREA

19
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,273
You didn’t have to come see me off.

20
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,488
I called in sick and took the day off
to come see you off,

21
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,741
so you could be nicer.

22
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,119
Did you come alone? What about Nobu?

23
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,247
He’s probably home crying about now.

24
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,791
After all, you only told him yesterday.

25
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,794
Put yourself in the position
of those who are left behind.

26
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:36,549
Sorry. I struggled to find
the right time to tell you guys.

27
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:42,013
Although we knew that this day
would come eventually.

28
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,352
-What is it?
-Your birthday present.

29
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,312
This piece of paper?

30
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,777
REN

31
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:01,115
Don’t get me wrong!
I’m not going to Tokyo to see him!

32
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,578
I know. That has nothing to do with this.

33
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,790
You don’t understand.

34
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,293
You don’t understand anything.

35
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,796
The train on platform one for Tokyo…

36
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,590
-If you understand my feelings…
-will be departing momentarily.

37
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,634
-then come with me…
-All passengers not aboard are asked…

38
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,761
-Yasu!
-to please board the train now.

39
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,640
Why can’t I say these few words?

40
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:30,603
Because… you’ve chosen your path in life.

41
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:34,607
And Nobu has a great future ahead of him.

42
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,235
I can’t say it.

43
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,906
So you have to wish for it yourself.

44
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,367
Nana.

45
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,247
Don’t go.

46
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,960
It’ll be lonely without you.

47
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,052
Stop messing with me! Then come with me!

48
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,892
I guess negotiations break off there.
Oh well, good luck.

49
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,520
Yasu! There are law firms in Tokyo, too!

50
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,982
You can sing in this town, too.

51
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,159
But…

52
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,538
there is no big stage like
the Tokyo Dome or the Budokan here.

53
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,256
Think of it as a foolish dream
if you want.

54
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:45,261
But one day,
I will definitely perform on a big stage.

55
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,971
I’ll perform
under an incredible number of spotlights

56
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,556
among a cheering crowd

57
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,350
and earn so much money
I won’t know how to spend it.

58
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,813
I’m not some princess
who is satisfied just singing.

59
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,485
Singing is my means to live.

60
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,071
So one day, I’ll definitely…

61
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,951
What the… Who the…

62
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,788
And how long does she intend
to stay on top of me?

63
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,208
Are you all right?

64
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,752
I’m fine. Sorry!

65
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:23,549
I’ll never forget that day.
March 5th, 2001.

66
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,259
My twentieth birthday.

67
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,346
That’s the day I met you.

68
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,644
That stupid Demon Lord!

69
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,270
It’s nothing to cry about.

70
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,357
But I was really looking forward
to the fireworks!

71
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,235
I even withdrew cash
from my savings to buy a yukata to wear!

72
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,780
So you finally dipped
into Natsuko’s 300,000 yen.

73
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,618
We met on the train to Tokyo.

74
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,454
I ended up moving in together
with Nana Komatsu.

75
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,790
Nickname Hachi or Hachiko.

76
00:06:55,873 --> 00:07:00,294
Hachiko is selfish,
overly dependent and cries easily.

77
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:04,340
She is completely boy crazy,
and she’s quick to switch over.

78
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:08,678
She’s only been in Tokyo for six months,
and she’s already dating a third guy.

79
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,846
Nobu…

80
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:14,100
But she would remain uncorrupted.
She was a strange woman.

81
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,856
Typhoon Eleven, which has made
its way onto land in the Kanto region,

82
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,316
is getting stronger as it continues north
and is expected to reach…

83
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,278
-Are you that jealous of our happiness?
-the Tohoku area later tonight…

84
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,321
-Well, I do understand how you feel.
-and Hokkaido tomorrow morning.

85
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,657
-Are you talking to the Demon Lord again?
-Total rain accumulation is estimated…

86
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,034
-I worry about you, Nobu.
-at 200ml in the Kanto region,

87
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,495
-But I’ll let it go since Hachi’s cute.
-150ml in the Tohoku region,

88
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,665
-Wrong. I’m talking to the weather girl.
-and 100 to 150ml in Hokkaido.

89
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,500
-Now I’m even more worried.
-Now, tomorrow’s weather.

90
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,253
First, the Kyushu and Okinawa regions…

91
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,588
-Na…
-Nobu! What are you doing?

92
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,089
Come here right now!

93
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,841
You promised to pick up Hachiko
at seven o’clock, right?

94
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,927
But we can’t go anywhere in this typhoon.

95
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,263
The fireworks will be canceled anyway.

96
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,391
Don’t you wanna see Hachiko in her yukata?

97
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,809
It’s bound to give you a nosebleed.

98
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,606
Why are you coming too, Shin?

99
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:05,776
-I wanna see Hachi in a kimono, too!
-It’s not a kimono, it’s a yukata!

100
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,695
What’s the difference?

101
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,952
-She’s so cute!
-She’s so cute!

102
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,497
We bought fireworks.

103
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,499
Let’s go to the river and light them
after the storm passes.

104
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,084
Really? Thanks!

105
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,461
YASU

106
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:29,008
Hachi was like a pet
that belonged to our band.

107
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,969
Well, a better term would be
our queen bee.

108
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:37,225
Just having Hachi there
smiling brightened the place up.

109
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,143
It gave everyone added energy
in the studio

110
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,561
as well as during live performances.

111
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,524
I felt it had more meaning to the band
than getting another member,

112
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,568
no matter how skilled
that band member may be.

113
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,452
Look at all the water from the rain.
The riverbed has disappeared.

114
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,287
I'm glad the barriers didn't collapse.

115
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,207
The fireworks won’t light up!

116
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,126
Damn! They’re damp because of the rain.

117
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,504
-Ow!
-Are you all right?

118
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,089
Oh, it’s better you don’t touch it.

119
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,382
Wanna go to the convenience store again?

120
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,636
I got one lit, Nana. Here.

121
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,429
Thank you!

122
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,056
Very impressive, Yasu.

123
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,516
Light one up for me, too.

124
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,477
-You want one too, Misato?
-Yes!

125
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,020
Hey, what about me?

126
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,482
-Here, Nobu. I’ll lend you my spark.
-Thank you.

127
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,988
Here.

128
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,368
Is it innocence or deceit?

129
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,169
Nana!

130
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,343
You probably don’t realize it, do you?

131
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,762
Every move you make…

132
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:04,020
stirs my heart around
with the strength of a typhoon.

133
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:12,486
I feel like a teenage boy
falling in love for the first time.

134
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,490
It feels like my heart is about to burst.

135
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,665
-Do you wanna do it with Hachiko?
-It’s not like that!

136
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,251
That head of yours really does
only think about doing it!

137
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,254
But a young man in love for the first time

138
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,922
is totally battling
against his sexual desire.

139
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,384
Yes, it is a battle.
But it’s not about sexual desire.

140
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,136
Then more like an appetite?

141
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,096
Yeah, she does look delicious.
Like rice cake.

142
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,848
Rice cake?

143
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,477
AND CUTE

144
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,770
When I talk with you,

145
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,272
I feel like a total idiot
for seriously worrying about stuff.

146
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,232
I’m glad about that.

147
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,109
Because you’ve always had the tendency

148
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,570
to take things
too negatively and seriously.

149
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,115
Hachi seems to be really
affectionate with you,

150
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,576
so you should be glad that
someone cares about you so much.

151
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,372
Treat her as well as your heart desires.

152
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,332
There’s nothing wrong with that.

153
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,709
Yeah, but…

154
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,627
Edamame!

155
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,338
Well, now that you mention it,
that does make sense.

156
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,341
But I hate feeling persuaded like that!

157
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:19,345
Why am I always influenced
by what Ren says or does?

158
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,555
I can understand that
being the case in the past,

159
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,349
but why is it still like that?

160
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,017
I haven’t matured a bit.

161
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,854
First of all, I had no intention
of getting back together with him.

162
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,233
So why am I seeing him
like a part-time wife?

163
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:37,071
Why am I making miso soup?
And at this time of the night?

164
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,698
-Because it’s my favorite, right?
-Well, yeah, but…

165
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,473
Hey, where’s your on-off switch?

166
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,143
I don’t have one.

167
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,358
If there is one, install it in me.

168
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:19,989
Someone… please adjust me.

169
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:26,579
Why does my heart still burn

170
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,373
so hot?

171
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,431
Hello?

172
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:49,018
Oh, Take. Good morning.

173
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,731
No, it’s okay. I’ll take my car.

174
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,775
I’ll leave in thirty minutes.

175
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,988
He’s hardly had any sleep.

176
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,073
He’s gonna make himself sick.

177
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:08,454
But…
I do envy him for having so much work.

178
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,748
In fact, it’s frustrating.

179
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,626
You could stay in bed longer.

180
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,629
If you try living like me,
you’ll die young.

181
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,464
But I have to go to work.

182
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,761
The moving company Nobu works at
is short of staff,

183
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,262
so he introduced me
and got me a job there.

184
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,349
A moving company? That’s a manly job.

185
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:34,104
I can no longer work in the evenings
with our band practicing every night,

186
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,398
so I need to make my earnings
during the day.

187
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,277
What's going on with your debut?
Any progress?

188
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,403
Not really.

189
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:50,788
Back then, I stayed at Ren’s place
for about half of the week,

190
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,915
but we missed each other often

191
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,125
and would only see each other
for short periods.

192
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,505
When we were together,

193
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,258
we couldn’t control our passion
for each other,

194
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,636
so we hardly spent any time
talking about ourselves.

195
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,351
But I thought it was better that way

196
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,771
because that way we could avoid
unnecessary subjects

197
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,356
that would only make us feel awkward.

198
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,332
What? Still there?

199
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,251
So annoying, aren’t they?

200
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,962
Maybe I should move.
But maybe that won’t make any difference.

201
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,714
Huh? What? Those papa-rakkyos?

202
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,967
Not the rakkyos!
I’m talking about that woman!

203
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,844
I told you to have her go home!

204
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,388
Rakkyo makes me wanna eat curry and rice.

205
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,558
Yeah? I prefer Fukujinzuke
on my curry rice.

206
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,603
What? Curry rice wouldn’t be complete
without a raw egg.

207
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,562
Right, Takumi?

208
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,064
I don’t eat the common folk’s food!

209
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,149
BEEF CURRY

210
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,235
Open a pack of curry,
and heat it in a pot.

211
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,864
When you find you’re running short,
add a pack at a time.

212
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,867
Be careful so that it doesn’t burn
and stick to the pot.

213
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,079
The rice is already cooked,

214
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,625
so place a little on each plate…

215
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,462
Ms. Komatsu?

216
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,175
SERVICE AND GOODS ENTRANCE

217
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,677
I’m very sorry.

218
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,348
It can’t be helped.
You’re not feeling well.

219
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,683
Thank goodness it happened
before we let the customers in.

220
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,185
I am really sorry.

221
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,646
You mustn’t take
summer heat fatigue lightly.

222
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,065
You’d better go see a doctor.

223
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,485
Yes.

224
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:30,322
PHARMACY

225
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,758
You’re eating it.
And at an employees’ cafeteria.

226
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,511
THE COMMON FOLK’S CURRY RICE

227
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,097
These things are usually
the furthest from my mind,

228
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,765
so why is it that
when I suddenly remember it,

229
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,809
I suddenly crave it?

230
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,354
Bottom line is, you love the stuff?

231
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,082
-I wish it would end already.
-What?

232
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,252
Summer vacation.

233
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,549
Only three more days.

234
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,844
Summer vacation seems like
a long break, but it goes by so fast.

235
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,723
If at least discussions
about your debut were more concrete,

236
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,683
I could go home feeling relieved.

237
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,601
WORLD HISTORY, JAPANESE HISTORY,
BIOLOGY, SCIENCE, MATH

238
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,686
It’s been a month already
since you signed that contract,

239
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,898
but you don't even have an agency yet.

240
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,859
It’s only a temporary contract after all.

241
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:53,030
I’m not quite clear on the meaning
of that temporary contract.

242
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,908
How is it different
from the official contract?

243
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,952
I’d say it’s something like
an engagement before a wedding?

244
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:03,749
Mr. Kawano is presently working hard
to collect funds and personnel

245
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:08,128
to organize a big reception for us.

246
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,549
The contract is there
so we remain faithful to them,

247
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,968
even if others approach us.

248
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:19,765
In turn, we’re free to use
Gaia’s music studios as much as we want

249
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,309
while we prepare to be beautiful brides.

250
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,227
I get it!

251
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,439
I finally understand now. Thank you.

252
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,527
Hey, Misato. You’re older than me,
so why do you talk so politely to me?

253
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,990
Well, you’re younger than me, Shin,

254
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:40,369
so how come you’re able to help me
with my 12th grade homework?

255
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,871
I can only help you with your English.

256
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,165
Have Yasu or someone help you
with the other stuff.

257
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,501
-I knew it!
-You knew it?

258
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,504
You have that pretty and luminous face
because you’re only half-Japanese, right?

259
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,506
Pretty and luminous?

260
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,800
You can hide it all you want,
but I can tell.

261
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,760
That’s why your English is so good, right?

262
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,265
My English is good
because I was raised abroad.

263
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,058
My parents are both Japanese.

264
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,394
What? Raised abroad? Where?

265
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,647
I mean, so you're not half-Japanese
with that face?

266
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,357
Don’t you believe me?

267
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,733
I don’t.

268
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,323
I don’t either.

269
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,327
They shouldn’t have given birth to me.

270
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,938
SPEEDY RESULTS INSTRUCTIONS

271
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:08,540
All right! All right! Okay, stop!

272
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,918
SEAGULL DELIVERY SERVICE

273
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,503
Wow, such a huge mansion!

274
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,258
It’s small! Too small!

275
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,429
It’s nothing compared to the future house
of Nana from BLAST.

276
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,765
I’ll show you, Demon Lord!

277
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,267
I see you’ve also become
a believer of the Demon Lord.

278
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:31,063
No way! The Demon Lord is my underling.

279
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:37,236
Back then, I had a dream
that I couldn’t give up.

280
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,863
Thanks to that,
I was able to obtain so much,

281
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,783
and at the same time,
lose something so precious.

282
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:48,538
But I lived life to the fullest,
so I have no regrets.

283
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,207
Just…

284
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,126
there’s one thing that
weighs heavy on my heart.

285
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,546
Hey, Hachi…

286
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,425
Right now… Are you smiling?
