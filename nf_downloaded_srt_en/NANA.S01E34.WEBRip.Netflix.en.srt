1
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:05,213
In the summer when I was 16,

2
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:07,757
I changed my brand of cigarettes
to Seven Stars

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,468
because Ren smoked them.

4
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:14,055
I increased my number
of piercings to match his

5
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,433
and I wore matching boots.

6
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:20,311
We slept in the same bed,
and we dreamt the same dream.

7
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:25,024
Still, Ren left me behind.

8
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:29,612
Perhaps, somewhere deep in my heart,

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,699
I had not forgiven him for that…

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,829
the same way that
I couldn’t forgive my mother.

11
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:05,982
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

12
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:30,024
I’m so weak willed.
This is already my fifth one.

13
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,443
I could only manage to quit
for three months.

14
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,406
But I need something to relax me.

15
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,661
I wonder what happened to Nobu after that.

16
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,707
I came down hard on him,
saying some merciless things.

17
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,128
I’ll apologize to him
when I see him at work.

18
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,923
But… will he come?

19
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,933
06:42 AM

20
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,269
I’m so sleepy.

21
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,938
I’m not in the mood to go to work.

22
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,650
But I have to make a living.

23
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,029
It does help to not have to pay
for the studio,

24
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,405
but how much longer will it take

25
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,407
for things to start moving
towards our debut?

26
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,288
I wonder if Hachi’s asleep.

27
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:32,378
Takumi has recording,
so he would’ve left by now.

28
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:35,798
Welcome home.

29
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,728
Don’t ignore me!

30
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,733
Come here and have a seat.

31
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,151
I have something important
to discuss with you.

32
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,237
I’ve gotta get changed and go to work.

33
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,072
Then come out after you get changed.

34
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,532
It won’t take much time.

35
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:08,498
And put out that cigarette, okay?
It’s bad for the baby.

36
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,254
Calm down.

37
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:20,593
I've decided to watch over Hachi gently
no matter what she decides to do.

38
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,444
You want something to drink?

39
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,297
We’ve decided to get married.

40
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,468
Get married?

41
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,973
So, I’ve gotta first talk this over
with my agent

42
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,726
on how we should proceed with this,

43
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,313
but I wanna hurry
and find a new place for her.

44
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,941
This place has no elevator,
which is hard on a pregnant woman.

45
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,820
And she has a tendency to be careless,
so it has to be a place with security.

46
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:25,074
So, I’m sorry but…
could you find a new roommate?

47
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,786
What the hell?

48
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,789
Why are things jumping forward so quickly?

49
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,294
I wasn’t even aware
that you were pregnant.

50
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,922
And what about Nobu?

51
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,842
Why are you keeping quiet?

52
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,261
I don’t get it.

53
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:48,765
But sure, that’s not fair to you
having her move out so suddenly,

54
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,934
so I’ll pay half the rent
until you find a new roommate.

55
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:52,935
I don’t need your money!

56
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,564
Really? But we created
these circumstances.

57
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,067
Actually, the timing’s perfect.

58
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,694
I was planning on moving in
with Ren anyway.

59
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,698
If that’s the case,
we’ll just stop renting this place.

60
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,287
No, wait…

61
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,123
I wanted to talk to you about that too.

62
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,959
You need to think
about Ren’s situation a bit.

63
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,504
-Huh?
-About your relationship.

64
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,172
If everything from your past
until now comes to light,

65
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:24,967
it's the kind of thing
the tabloids go after.

66
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,262
So what? If Trapnest is gonna fail
because of some scandal,

67
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,014
then it’s not much
of a band to begin with.

68
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:35,269
No, in fact, I’m more worried
about us receiving more attention.

69
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,606
When a band becomes as popular as ours,

70
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:43,569
the public gradually shows more interest
in things other than the band’s music.

71
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,239
It can't be helped.
And we can take advantage of it, too.

72
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:50,034
But honestly, I’d hate for us to be judged

73
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:54,956
because of stuff unrelated to our music.

74
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,501
So I want to avoid the chance
of scandal encouraging that.

75
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,255
As someone involved in the music business,
I’m sure you'd understand.

76
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,593
How are you okay with getting married?

77
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,972
Me getting married won’t attract
much attention from the public.

78
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,641
I’m not nearly as recognized as Ren.

79
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,018
Besides, I don't think

80
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,230
you wanna draw attention
in that way before your debut.

81
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,359
Of course not! I couldn't stand it.

82
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,820
Then you need to be more cautious
with your actions.

83
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,947
I’m not telling you not to see him.

84
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,368
I get it. I’ll be more careful.

85
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,621
I'm glad you get it.

86
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,416
I tried to talk to Ren about this,
but he refuses to listen to me,

87
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,375
so it was bothering me.

88
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,755
That’s all I have to talk about.
I should be heading back.

89
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,637
What’s with her?

90
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,058
She’s like Takumi’s faithful dog.

91
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,858
I won’t be able to come
during our recording…

92
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,570
but when we’re done,
we’ll go and meet your parents.

93
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,823
So don’t worry unnecessarily
and get lots of rest.

94
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,493
But I don’t feel that ill that
I need to stay in bed.

95
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,579
While you’re away,
I’ll go see a real estate agent.

96
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,997
What kind of place
should I be looking for?

97
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,334
You’re even hastier than I am.

98
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,586
Are you that eager to play newlyweds?

99
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,423
I was just thinking you’re really busy,
so I wanted to help in any way that I can.

100
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,927
You wanna move out fast

101
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,929
because you’re finding it hard
to face Nana, right?

102
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,474
She seems to be very good friends
with Nobu,

103
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,767
so it's gotta be uncomfortable.

104
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,435
And she doesn’t hide the fact
that she’s upset about this.

105
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,354
FROM: REIRA
SUBJECT: GOOD MORNING.

106
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,355
I’M DONE WITH THE LYRICS.

107
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,606
IT’S AN INNOCENT LOVE STORY.
FROM LOVELY REIRA

108
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,110
I’ll talk to someone at my agency
about finding a place

109
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,530
and have him list up a few options.

110
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,031
You can go view those places
when you’re better

111
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,951
and decide on a place you like.

112
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,499
You’re not looking as pale.
Are you feeling less nauseous?

113
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,293
Mm-hmm. Thanks. I feel much better.

114
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,264
Takumi…
Shouldn’t you be going to your recording?

115
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,267
I still have plenty of time.

116
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,478
But this may not be good for the baby.

117
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,980
It’ll be fine. It’ll be fine.

118
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,773
Nana will hear us.

119
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,149
Don’t worry.

120
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,776
Just keep your voice down,
and she’ll never notice.

121
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,487
But she’s already pretty angry!

122
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,698
I need you to tame my anger first!

123
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,370
I can't stand the thought
of some other guy doing it with you.

124
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:47,378
Don’t you worry about a thing
and just focus on pleasing me.

125
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,382
The bed we got
from Mizukoshi’s store was old,

126
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,428
and the bedsprings would squeak.

127
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,141
It’s driving me crazy.

128
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,686
You’re a lot more important
to me than a boyfriend, Nana.

129
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,479
You liar!

130
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:09,859
It seems like I’m head over heels
in love with Nobu.

131
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,777
You traitor!

132
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,825
Could you find a new roommate?

133
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,161
Tell me that yourself, Nana!

134
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,835
If you don't want it,
I don't want it either.

135
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,920
I wanna use the same things you do.

136
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,923
Why don’t you use the strawberry glass?

137
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,136
Because there are only two of them.
What if I break one?

138
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,473
But if you don’t use them,
what’s the point of having them?

139
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,100
Yeah, but still, it’s too sad
if one of a set breaks.

140
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,901
You can use it, but be sure
to be careful, okay?

141
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,879
It’s too sad if one of a set breaks.

142
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,375
-Nana?
-Don't mind her.

143
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,294
Good…

144
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,172
They're together.

145
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,803
I’m not sad anymore.

146
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,574
Huh?

147
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,578
When did you get here?

148
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,838
A ring of oath.

149
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,508
Our red string. We can't see it now.

150
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,760
No promises either.

151
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,514
What part of this is
an innocent love story?

152
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,516
It seems to me more like
a song about infidelity.

153
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,352
-Huh?
-Huh? But there's no ring of oath, right?

154
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,729
Yes, but you could interpret this

155
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,606
as the other guy having
a ring on his finger.

156
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,523
Huh?

157
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,735
You know, you’ve been acting
awfully suspicious lately, Reira.

158
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,320
Are you having an affair?

159
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,822
That’s not what it means!

160
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,950
But songs about infidelity
sell pretty well!

161
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,620
But it’s not like that, Mari!
This is about pure love!

162
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,623
A love that binds people together
but one where you don’t even kiss!

163
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,626
-Speaking of ring of oath, Take…
-Hm?

164
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,127
I’m getting married.

165
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,545
-Huh?
-It’s all right, isn’t it?

166
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,255
-You're getting married?
-You're getting married?

167
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,841
What are you saying
all of a sudden, Takumi?

168
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,343
And to say it here?

169
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,012
I trust the staff members here.

170
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,556
-I-- I need an explanation!
-Huh?

171
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,807
You getting married is even less likely

172
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,810
than this single selling
ten million copies!

173
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,687
My woman’s pregnant.

174
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,855
Hachiko?

175
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,190
You sure know a lot.

176
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,193
It’s not like you, Takumi.
It’s not like you!

177
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,446
It's not Nobu's baby?

178
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,741
Why would you fall
for Hachiko’s tactics so easily like that?

179
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:46,742
Tactics?

180
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:47,910
Hachiko’s objectives are to earn

181
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,912
the status of being the wife
of a popular musician and your money!

182
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,081
She may have even lured you
into doing it when she was ovulating!

183
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:53,958
TAKUMI

184
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,377
Takumi, I wanna see you!

185
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,923
No, I doubt it was something
she did on purpose.

186
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,050
But her objectives may be as you say.

187
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,385
Are you fine with a loveless relationship?

188
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,138
Love comes later.

189
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:12,017
People love themselves more
than anyone else.

190
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:16,105
They end up loving those who
can fulfill the most of their desires.

191
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,149
-In a way, that’s true.
-Huh?

192
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,153
Why not? Let them get married, Take.

193
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,905
Why don’t we see where a relationship

194
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,032
between a bastard
and a fad follower will take them?

195
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:27,950
This could be fun.

196
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,452
Easy for you to say.

197
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,204
Anyway, we must discuss this
with the president.

198
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,373
Until we do, please,
everyone, keep this a secret.

199
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,251
What a pain.
Let me do as I wish! It’s my marriage!

200
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,838
Well then, let’s get started
with the recording.

201
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,506
Huh? Where’s Reira?

202
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,633
She was here until a moment ago.

203
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,844
I’m sure she’ll be right back.

204
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,721
We record the vocals later anyway.

205
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,973
We can do it without temporary vocals.

206
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,979
-Mari, could you please go look for her?
-Yes.

207
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,277

ENGLISH SONGS

209
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,907
What? Reira’s your real name?

210
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:13,245
Mm-hmm. Well, almost.
It’s spelled L-A-Y-L-A.

211
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,331
You know the Eric Clapton song, "Layla"?

212
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,083
Yeah. It's a famous song.

213
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:22,171
My father loved that song,
so he named me after it.

214
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,924
Even now when I’m alone in my room,

215
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:29,428
I play that CD, and I don’t feel alone.

216
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,222
Lovely Layla.

217
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,517
The Japanese title is
a bit embarrassing…

218
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,062
That’ll be 5,500 yen.

219
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,528
I’ll be in touch.

INCOMING CALL
LAYLA

222
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,093
Yes?

223
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,013
Hello?

224
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,059
Hello?

225
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,770
-Shin…
-What’s the matter?

226
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,482
Where are you now, Reira?
What about the recording?

227
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,320
Did something happen?

228
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,575
Reira, are you all right?

229
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,831
Please do me a favor.

230
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:40,874
I’m sorry.

231
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,335
Just tell me what it is. I’ll do anything.

232
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,593
I don’t need any more money.

233
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,598
-Yasu…
-Huh?

234
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,602
What?

235
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:05,816
Please give me Yasu’s cell number.

236
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,867
-Hello…
-Nana?

237
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,286
What the hell are you doing?

238
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,539
-You had me worried!
-Nobu?

239
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,207
I called you multiple times
since this morning,

240
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,542
but you don’t pick up!

241
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,877
I panicked last night
and said some mean things.

242
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,589
But I'm the one this is happening to
and went to work today,

243
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,216
so how dare you take the day off!

244
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,593
I’m starting to hate myself
for being so damn serious.

245
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,762
MISSED CALL
NOBU

246
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:03,225
-Ah, sorry.
-Never mind.

247
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:09,273
I’m used to your merciless oppression,
and I covered for you at work.

248
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,941
Where are you now?

249
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,032
At Ren’s… place?

250
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,119
I’m guessing Ren’s not there
because of work, right?

251
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,912
I’m done with work today.

252
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,082
Wanna grab a bite
before going to the studio?

253
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,083
Nobu…

254
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,712
My treat! You've gotta
let me spill out my sad story!

255
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,923
I’m thinking, there really is
something wrong with me.

256
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,009
I already know that, from long ago!

257
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,471
I can’t remember why I’m here.

258
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,224
Am I still only half awake?

259
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,779
The last thing I remember

260
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,033
was the strawberry glass
about to roll off the table.

261
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:07,497
Those matching glasses were
the first things

262
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,542
we bought together…

263
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,964
Was I able to catch that glass…

264
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,551
before it fell?

265
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,527
You know, Hachi…

266
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,867
I was too small of a person
to be able to accept everything about you.

267
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,203
I was like a cheap glass.

268
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:52,876
It's just that I preferred the pain
of breaking into pieces

269
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,713
to the loneliness I felt
from losing everything.

270
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:57,839
LOVELY LAYLA

271
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,221
I was just too fragile.

272
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,516
It’s not your fault.
