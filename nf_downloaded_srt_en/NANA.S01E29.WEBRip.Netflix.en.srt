1
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:07,549
On the wall discolored by the sun,
the poster mark remained.

2
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:35,910
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

3
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,439
You’re an only child, Nobu?

4
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,526
Yeah. My parents must be crying about now.

5
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,652
Or rather, they must be really pissed off.

6
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:54,405
I see. I guess you were supposed
to take over your family inn, huh?

7
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,118
How big is it?

8
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,912
A SPOILED CHILD

9
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,665
You only remember things like that, huh?

10
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,333
What’s going on in this head?

11
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,379
But when BLAST officially debuts,

12
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,090
I’ll bet they’ll be so thrilled
they’ll forgive you right away.

13
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,509
So you’ve gotta do your best.

14
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,095
Yeah.
I’ll do my best for your sake too, Hachi.

15
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,222
I told you, don’t call me Hachi.

16
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,640
But if I call you "Nana,"

17
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:24,144
I can’t help but picture
the face of that cat-eyed queen.

18
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,229
Cat-eyed?

19
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,648
I’ve been calling her that
since the tenth grade,

20
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,692
so it’s become second nature now.

21
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,861
So BLAST has been around
since you were in the tenth grade?

22
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,114
No, we started the band during the summer
when I was in eleventh grade,

23
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,199
but Nana and I were classmates
in high school.

24
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,118
Really?

25
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,704
Hey, how was Nana in high school?

26
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:46,541
She never laughed, she didn’t talk much,
and she had this evil look in her eyes.

27
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,626
-She was totally isolated.
-No way.

28
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,753
I was so sure she was
really popular in school!

29
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,671
What a shock.

30
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,548
No, she was so gloomy.

31
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,133
She’s really pretty,

32
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,510
so even though she was quiet,
she did stand out in school.

33
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,637
But you could never tell
what she was thinking,

34
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,514
so everyone was too scared
to get close to her.

35
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,059
But when you think about it
in a normal sense,

36
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,770
it must've been lonely for her,
having no friends.

37
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:13,026
So I tried blitzing her
with my non-stop talking,

38
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,779
but then she just ignored me,
which left me feeling lonely.

39
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,991
So then,
the music-crazed youngster Nobu figured,

40
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,285
"If I can’t communicate with her
through words, I’ll do it through music."

41
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:26,623
So I made her borrow my CDs.
Ten of them, I think.

42
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,750
I tried to give her
different genres of music,

43
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,543
thinking there was bound
to be one she’d like.

44
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,256
Then she finally talked to me.

45
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,010
Terashima.

46
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,640
Thanks for these.

47
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,183
If you get some more good ones,
can I borrow them?

48
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,643
She smiled.

49
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,019
Ms. Osaki spoke?

50
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,562
-So she can speak after all.
-Wait, Osaki.

51
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,525
What’s your favorite genre?
Which one of those did you like?

52
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,652
What was it?

53
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,904
The noisiest one
with the kinda erotic name.

54
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,406
-The Sex Pistols?
-Yeah, that one.

55
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,409
My favorite’s punk, too!
We have the same taste!

56
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,702
How annoying.

57
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,246
I was so happy.

58
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,039
It was like
being liked back by your crush.

59
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,833
To me, that just sounds
like you were in love with her.

60
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,379
Maybe a little.

61
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,964
You fool! I hate you!

62
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,217
But that happened in the past!

63
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,428
Besides, once we became friends,

64
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,974
I realized that I wasn’t seeing her
as a woman.

65
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,560
Otherwise, I would never have
introduced her to Ren, right?

66
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,438
So you were the one
who brought the two together?

67
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,606
Yeah.

68
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,485
Nana had this dangerous, warped way
of thinking that no one could deal with.

69
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,321
I thought maybe Ren would be an exception
and could do something about it.

70
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,201
For the young Nobu,
Ren was an invincible hero.

71
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,789
It was a big success, huh?

72
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,834
-But not quite what I expected.
-What do you mean?

73
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,628
I realized little by little

74
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:59,007
that Ren wasn’t the strong person
I thought he was.

75
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,885
Perhaps Ren was saved just
as much as Nana was in this encounter.

76
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,105
You know, when I was younger,

77
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,359
for no good reason, I thought that
guys had to protect their girls.

78
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,778
So I always acted tough
in front of my girlfriend.

79
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,864
But that may have been a big mistake.

80
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,449
Huh? Why was that a mistake?

81
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,746
So you want to be supported
by these frail arms?

82
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,332
Yes. Totally.

83
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,249
It’s impossible.

84
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,376
Ever since I fell in love
with you, Hachiko,

85
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,255
I realized just how much
of a weak, shameless man I really am.

86
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,214
What do you mean?

87
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,633
Weren’t you gonna do anything
to make me happy?

88
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:47,638
Sure I will. As long as you’re always
by my side supporting me.

89
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:53,394
With you by my side,
I feel that I can do anything.

90
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,396
Sure.

91
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,693
Nobu loves to be pampered.

92
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,572
That’s a problem.
I’m the one who wants to be pampered.

93
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:10,787
But what is this feeling?
It feels really sweet.

94
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,291
I wanna be kind to him.
I wanna be by his side.

95
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:19,337
I wanna be of help to him.
I wanna hug him.

96
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,548
I wanna be able to do
everything he desires.

97
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:28,721
Until now, I’ve only thought
of being treated that way by men.

98
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,975
That may have been a big mistake.

99
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,062
Good morning.

100
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,818
Nana, you’re back here again.
What about Ren?

101
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,862
He’s busy with work right now,
so he’s hardly ever home.

102
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,697
You left Misato all alone.

103
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,491
Who were you with if it wasn’t Takumi?

104
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,452
Wh-- Where’s Misato?

105
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,495
She’s still sleeping.

106
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,831
I’d better explain everything to her.

107
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,999
But how am I gonna explain
so that she’d understand?

108
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,502
It happened immediately
after I broke it off with Takumi.

109
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,963
It actually overlapped a little.

110
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,632
I’ll think about it thoroughly today.

111
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,219
I’m working today,
so I’d better get changed and hurry off.

112
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,137
Oh, by the way…

113
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,640
Were you able to find
Nobu’s workplace yesterday?

114
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,643
Yeah, thanks. I had to see him
about something urgent.

115
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,854
You two really get along, don’t you?

116
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,984
That guy’s always been
a genuine, honest sort of guy,

117
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,111
so you two share the same values.

118
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,321
Well, from the rest of the world,

119
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,491
you’re like two little dogs barking
for attention,

120
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,201
which is kind of annoying.

121
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,329
I’m sure Nana will understand me.

122
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:39,083
She had to be lonely having no friends.

123
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,334
Because Nana for sure knows

124
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:44,213
a lot more great things
about Nobu than I do.

125
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,717
-Nana…
-Huh?

126
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,471
You know, I… Nobu…

127
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:59,979
It seems like I’m head over heels
in love with Nobu.

128
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,738
Isn’t it natural?

129
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,533
Nana didn’t ask me any questions.

130
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,328
And if I said anything more,

131
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,747
it would’ve sounded
like an excuse, so I didn’t.

132
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,710
There’s no need for me
to explain anything.

133
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,379
I just need to treasure Nobu. That’s all.

134
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,466
And Nana will always be watching over us.

135
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,886
Hey, look, Kyosuke did this.

136
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:35,556
This is incredibly well done.
That’s Mr. Kyosuke for you.

137
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,309
There’s no need to add the "Mr."
He’s the same age as you, after all.

138
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,187
But he just seems older than me.

139
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,523
Mr. Kyosuke’s somewhat like
a father to you.

140
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,234
Let’s leave it at older brother.

141
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,278
Look, that one over in that section.
That’s Jun-chan’s painting.

142
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,740
It's incredible! In many ways.

143
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,825
It’s impossible to comprehend, Jun-chan.

144
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,285
What is it? Can you explain it to me?

145
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,622
I’m the one who needs an explanation.

146
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,875
Huh? Nana and Nobu?

147
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,586
Yeah. All lovey-dovey.
So much that it’s sickening.

148
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,088
What’s that supposed to mean?

149
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,965
But I thought she preferred Yasu.

150
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,967
Maybe he didn't pay any attention to her.

151
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,470
But she could've told us sooner.

152
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,222
Why’d she hide it?

153
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,517
I think the guy she was hiding
from us was another guy.

154
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,561
I’ll bet he broke her heart.

155
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,648
In any case, she was really hurt
about what happened with her ex-boyfriend.

156
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,235
Maybe Nobu was kind to her then,
and she went along with it.

157
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,821
Yeah. But it was like
she had completely forgotten

158
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,073
about her ex-boyfriend
a little while back.

159
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,617
That’s true. I guess it just shows

160
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,328
that Nana’s ex wasn’t
all that important to her after all.

161
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,496
So you’re saying that

162
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,331
there are a lot of guys out there
who are better than her ex.

163
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,459
Oh, Mr. Ex-Boyfriend,
here’s your Jackson Burger.

164
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,628
Cut it out with all the "ex-boyfriend"!

165
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,214
Oh my, I didn’t notice you there, Shoji.
I’m sorry.

166
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,424
You’re the one who invited me to come!

167
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,926
But we always find you here
whether we call you or not.

168
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,429
Even though you live farther away
since you moved.

169
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,055
Huh? When did that happen?

170
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:58,973
Didn’t you tell me that

171
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,308
it wasn’t gonna happen
because you didn’t have money?

172
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:05,187
Shoji left his apartment
and moved to Sachiko’s place.

173
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,398
He made us help him move
although we were really busy.

174
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,941
So inconsiderate.

175
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,026
Hey, I never asked you to,

176
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,069
but you barged in
because you were curious.

177
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,447
Sachiko lives one train stop away
from you, right?

178
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,656
Yeah.

179
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,326
I’ll continue coming here from now on too,
so don’t worry, Koichi Sato.

180
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,369
-You don’t have to come.
-What?

181
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:25,207
Nana no longer comes here
because you continue to hang out here.

182
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,417
I’m sorry.

183
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,171
Tell Nana now that she has a boyfriend
that she’s all lovey-dovey with,

184
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,591
she can come here again
without thinking about her ex.

185
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,925
I do wanna see her new boyfriend.

186
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,136
Nobu hasn't been here before?

187
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,804
I believe he lives close by.

188
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,805
With his band and work,

189
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,183
I doubt he has the time
to sit back and enjoy a drink.

190
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,976
That guru hasn’t been here either,
has she?

191
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,977
Guru?

192
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,896
-Nana’s roommate.
-Oh…

193
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,314
Is her boyfriend good looking?

194
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,192
Average, I’d say.
But give him a guitar, and he changes.

195
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,486
He becomes this super cool dude.
He’s a mysterious guy.

196
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,987
I guess so.

197
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,114
He’s normally this helpless guy,
much like her ex-boyfriend.

198
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,741
Now that you mention it,

199
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,701
don’t you think that Nobu
and the ex-boyfriend are kinda similar?

200
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,578
Oh yeah, like the way they’re idiots
when they speak.

201
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,499
You think so? I think
her new boyfriend is conceited.

202
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,335
-Have you met him?
-No, I haven’t.

203
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,671
This is according to what
Nana told me about him.

204
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,840
Apparently, he’s the heir
to a Japanese inn,

205
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,051
but he threw that all away to pursue
his dream and came to Tokyo.

206
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,887
That alone would be enough
to have Nana fall for him.

207
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,557
He said something like this
to the guru in a serious tone.

208
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,894
"I’m happy as long
as I can play the guitar…

209
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,104
and have you sing to it."

210
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,440
Not something you can just blurt out
in a straight face.

211
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,109
That’s why you wouldn’t do it.

212
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,193
That’s so cold!

213
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,444
You're no good

214
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,530
because you can't heat things up.

215
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,198
You’re rather the type who acts cold

216
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,533
in order to hide your shyness.

217
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,743
However, I understand now.

218
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,414
I fully understand why Nana fell for Nobu.

219
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,707
That man surely knows how to please her.

220
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,961
He’ll normally be this good friend
who she can talk to about anything,

221
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,797
but when the time’s right,
he’ll say what a woman wants to hear.

222
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,841
He’s the ideal type as far
as Nana’s concerned.

223
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,093
I guess there's more to it than just
Nana going along with the flow.

224
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,720
This may turn out well.

225
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,307
What do you think, Shoji?

226
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,435
What do I think? I’m glad.

227
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,729
I wish for Nana’s happiness
with all my heart.

228
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:11,647
Are you lonely?

229
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,899
Koichi Sato! One more Jackson Burger.

230
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,651
I’m taking one to Sachiko.

231
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,070
-Welcome home, Shoji.
-A present for you.

232
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,698
You were at Jackson’s again? Thanks.

233
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,992
I’m sorry that it’s not
a Louis Vuitton bag.

234
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,410
I’m hopeless, aren’t I?

235
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,956
Actually, I prefer the Jackson Burger.

236
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,420
I wonder if we were too mean.

237
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,214
I don’t think so.
We needed to put him in his place.

238
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,132
We sure did that, didn’t we?

239
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,384
In his position,
Shoji’s not about to blurt out

240
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,845
that he’s lonely under any circumstance,

241
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,346
but he’s gotta be feeling lonely.

242
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,807
Men can be so selfish.

243
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,102
Although it would be annoying
if he didn't feel lonely at all.

244
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,647
Shoji did love Nana, after all.

245
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,942
He just loved Sachiko more.

246
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,694
But you know,

247
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:02,239
don’t you feel that’s because
Sachiko loved Shoji more than Nana?

248
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,532
You think so?

249
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,911
But didn’t Nana love Shoji enough
that she couldn’t live without him?

250
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:07,953
No.

251
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,580
Of course, there’s no way
of comparing the weight of love

252
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,040
Nana and Sachiko had for Shoji.

253
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,626
Just, Shoji probably felt more love
from Sachiko.

254
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,504
Maybe it’s a matter of how
they expressed their feelings.

255
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,047
Nana’s is very one-sided,

256
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,131
so it’s difficult to grasp exactly
what she feels.

257
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:23,135
Yeah. Come to think of it,
while Shoji went out with Nana,

258
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,347
he would often come to our place
to get drunk and complain about her.

259
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,726
"Nana doesn’t love me for who I am.
She only loves the me that loves her."

260
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,271
"You’re right!" I thought,
and I sympathized with him.

261
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,399
Well, although that likely
wasn’t Nana’s intention,

262
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,110
that’s how it looked like to others.

263
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,570
So when she found out that
he was cheating on her

264
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,989
and was quick to discard him,
saying she no longer wanted him,

265
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,991
that must’ve been a big blow to Shoji.

266
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,118
It was the type of shock
where he’s thinking,

267
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,745
"So that was the truth all along."

268
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:53,249
But Nana’s actions were more
because she doesn’t take pain well,

269
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,835
and so when she gets hurt,
the first thing she does is try to escape.

270
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,753
I think you're right.

271
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,256
She’ll quickly run away
and quickly put a lid on it.

272
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,091
She tries not to face her partner.

273
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,885
There's always that thing about her
that makes her seem like

274
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,680
she's having a conversation with herself,
even when she's talking to someone else.

275
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:12,601
But lately, she no longer comes crying
to you like she used to.

276
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,062
Maybe she is able to face her partner now.

277
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,064
Let’s hope that’s the case.

278
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,857
So if and when Nobu cheats on her,

279
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,527
I sure hope she shows enough passion
to go crying to him and not let him go.

280
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,321
Then if I cheat on you,

281
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,532
will you come crying to me
and not let me go?

282
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,742
No, I’ll beat you to death.

283
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,953
-I’m relieved, Junko.
-Why?

284
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:31,871
THERE’S STILL HOPE FOR US

285
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,498
It's all about how you
express your feelings, right?

286
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,375
NANA

287
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,005
This is the call center.

288
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,425
Please call again
without hiding your phone number.

289
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,596
So she suddenly doesn’t accept calls
from unidentified numbers! Why?

290
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,472
"I hate Takumi."

291
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,642
Ren, the next page.

292
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,979
Welcome back, Ren! I have some big news!

293
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,647
Nobu and Hachiko are together!

294
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,441
Huh? Then she’s going out with two guys?

295
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,650
Way to go, Hachiko.

296
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,693
What are you saying?

297
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,904
There’s no way Hachiko could manage
two guys at once.

298
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,238
She broke up with Takumi, right?

299
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:10,200
Really? Well, she has good reason
to dump that guy.

300
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,745
-All he thinks about is sex.
-The same with you!

301
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,914
Just call her without hiding your number.

302
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,790
There's even less of a chance
she'll pick up if she knows it’s me.

303
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,835
-Oh, right.
-Hachiko? I thought you two broke up.

304
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,838
Not really. She’s just pissed off at me.

305
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,591
By the way, where the hell is the crew?

306
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,676
They’re late! What do they take us for?

307
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,762
Takumi. We still have ten minutes.

308
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:30,679
I’M STAYING OUT OF THIS

309
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,938
Stop reading erotic comics.

310
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,564
I just happened to be reading that scene!

311
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,566
Is Hachiko not enough to satisfy you?

312
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,777
No, I am more than satisfied.

313
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,695
Is she that good?

314
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,323
When I talk to you,
I don’t feel like I’m talking to a woman.

315
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:53,160
But I’m glad, Nobu.
You succeeded in making Hachiko yours.

316
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,829
-I am very grateful to you.
-Huh?

317
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:59,541
I know that you were rooting for me.

318
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,294
I got this really warm feeling
of friendship from you.

319
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,255
So annoying. It wasn’t for your sake.

320
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,716
Of course! It was for Hachi then!

321
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,594
You thought that, of all people,
I could make Hachiko happy, right?

322
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,887
I sure will make her happy!

323
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,889
It’s not like that.

324
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,892
I hate to say this, but I just used you.

325
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,520
As a way to get revenge against Takumi?

326
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,938
-It’s not that.
-Then what?

327
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,068
So that Hachiko can run freely
without a leash in my yard.

328
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,490
So keep an eye on her,

329
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,535
so that she doesn’t ever escape
to some other place.

330
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,037
Nobu!

331
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,331
Nana!

332
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:51,051
I guess a person’s true nature
will never change.

333
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,096
She’s still the same girl
with the same warped way of thinking.

334
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,266
I'd thought she became
softer because of Ren.

335
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,060
But Nana’s desire to possess
is abnormally strong,

336
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,479
even with regards to Ren.

337
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,690
I mean, with that padlock and all.

338
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,650
Huh? But that’s because she’s
a fan of Sid Vicious.

339
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,610
It’s just a copy of that.
It’s nothing more.

340
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,446
I think there is.

341
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:14,366
And she’s even got a tattoo
that’s a symbol of Ren’s name on her body.

342
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,617
No matter how much she loves him,

343
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,619
don’t you find that scary for her
to go that far?

344
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,539
And then for Ren to gladly accept that

345
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,876
and continue wearing that
for two years after they broke up?

346
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,211
I find him quite eccentric as well.

347
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:30,049
But Hachi talks of them
as the ideal couple.

348
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,760
Perhaps I’m the one who has
a warped way of thinking.

349
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,553
So you’re saying Nana’s met her soulmate?

350
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,680
Oh, I love such stories.

351
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,645
Keiko? Oh boy. She can be a real sadist.

352
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,147
Huh? Real sadist?

353
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,859
I won’t be coming back tonight.
Why not have Hachi come over again?

354
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:52,071
I am really happy that you
and Hachi are together.

355
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,240
But weren’t you supporting us

356
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,409
because you wanted to keep her
in your yard as your pet?

357
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,578
You talked of me getting her back
as if she were a dog.

358
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,957
But you’re wrong.
I just wanted you to show me the answer.

359
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,375
The answer?

360
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,669
"Men and women are
simply opposing creatures

361
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,088
driven toward each other by lust.

362
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,799
"Can they be connected by love?"

363
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,425
But you two connected, didn’t you?

364
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,177
Well, you’re already having sex,

365
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,179
but that’s natural
between two people who love each other.

366
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,015
So love does tie you together, right?

367
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,520
Try it yourself if you wanna find out.

368
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,316
It’s impossible for me.

369
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,570
We will first have them
sign a temporary contract,

370
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,697
and once details of their first CD release
have been determined,

371
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,783
we’ll switch to an official contract.

372
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:43,080
I will do my best to make sure we switch
to the official contract right away,

373
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,748
but it doesn’t always go as I wish…

374
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,458
Never mind the details.

375
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,919
Anyway, I just need to put
my signature and seal

376
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,420
on this temporary contract, right?

377
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,965
Yes, well…

378
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,510
I entrust him to you.

379
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,804
Still, I’m a little worried
about the world of show business.

380
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,973
I have children too,

381
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,684
so I understand your worries
about your precious son…

382
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,185
No, that’s not it.

383
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,895
With show business,

384
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,023
the media tries to dig up everything
about a person’s private life, right?

385
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,441
I don’t want anything happening

386
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,777
that’ll end up affecting
my elder son and me.

387
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:22,119
Well, we thought it best to keep
his real name and profile a secret

388
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:25,956
and try to say he's eighteen.

389
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:26,915
That would be--

390
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,041
You can do anything you wish

391
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,127
as long as you keep
his true identity a secret.

392
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,754
I don’t want the world to know
about the embarrassment of my family.

393
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,633
Also, could you mail me
the official contract?

394
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:40,345
I can’t be wasting time
on something like this.

395
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,097
OKAZAKI

396
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,600
-Now, if you’ll excuse me…
-Mr. Okazaki.

397
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,312
He may not be your flesh and blood,

398
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,814
but you did raise that child
for fifteen years.

399
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,941
Don’t you have any feelings
of love for that child?

400
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:59,364
Unfortunately, I have never felt love
for Shinichi.

401
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,241
Not even once.

402
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,994
Even though I tried my best.

403
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,841
Ms. Hachiko, we’re almost out of paint.

404
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,801
-Is it okay if I open a new one?
-Sure.

405
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,804
Sorry for having you help
with this, Misato.

406
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,432
No, this is a lot of fun.

407
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:29,937
Painting the walls white makes
the whole room brighter. This is great.

408
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,734
All I wanna do is seal off my memories.

409
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:40,072
Why do I feel like some criminal
destroying evidence?

410
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:46,411
Am I still making another one
of my mistakes?

411
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,293
Hey, Nana…

412
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,545
Mistakes we made

413
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,298
and the scars we have won't just disappear

414
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,384
by simply covering them up.

415
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,762
So I'm still calling your name, Nana…

416
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:08,392
no matter how much it hurts…
until you answer me.
