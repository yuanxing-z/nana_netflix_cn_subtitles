1
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:06,673
They say that the closer you are,
the more you fight,

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,052
but fighting is nothing
but a clash of egos.

3
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,179
Revealing your true feelings

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,849
doesn’t necessarily make people
understand each other better.

5
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:21,604
I think it’s probably impossible
to live your life without getting hurt,

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:26,192
but I also think an effort
should be made not to hurt others.

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,905
I just felt so strongly about that.

8
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:35,493
FROM NANA

9
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:59,517
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

10
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,470
HACHI - SEPTEMBER 11TH 08:56 A.M.
GOOD MORNING

11
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,224
THANKS FOR CALLING ME LAST NIGHT.

12
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,892
I WAS REALLY HAPPY TO HEAR FROM YOU,

13
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,436
SO I’M SORRY FOR HANGING UP ON YOU
SO ABRUPTLY.

14
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,690
I THOUGHT LONG AND HARD AFTER THAT

15
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:32,026
AND REALIZED THERE’S SOMETHING
I MUST TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

16
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:48,251
Good morning, Reira. Did you sleep well?

17
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,463
Yes. My head is clear, perhaps
because I didn’t take any medication.

18
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:57,719
Is that so? That’s good, since you have
to talk to a lot of people today.

19
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,596
-A lot?
-Yes.

20
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,391
In the morning, you have an interview with
a women’s magazine here in this hotel.

21
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,727
In the afternoon, we change locations,
and all band members will give interviews

22
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,896
to three music magazines
and two information magazines.

23
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,523
In the evening, you have
two radio show recordings.

24
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,484
I’m so sorry for scheduling
all this for one day.

25
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:17,363
No, the recording got delayed
all because of me.

26
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,741
-I’m really sorry.
-It’s okay.

27
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:22,493
Can I take a shower?
Do we still have time?

28
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,287
Yes. The hair and make-up people

29
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,497
are scheduled to be here
in thirty minutes.

30
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,707
What do you wish to do about breakfast?

31
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,002
Just order something from room service.

32
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,003
Yes.

33
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,822
You forgot it on purpose, didn’t you?

34
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:12,335
I had a day off from work that day,

35
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:16,297
so I spent the day sleeping peacefully
in Ren’s arms for the first time in days.

36
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:20,593
I woke up feeling that
my troubles had disappeared.

37
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,265
Damn, I left my umbrella at Ren’s place.

38
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,896
Tell him that I won’t be seeing him
for a while.

39
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,776
Knowing Nobu, he probably never told him.

40
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,946
That guy’s really useless.

41
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,450
Is your pride that important to you?

42
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,205
Here, here.

43
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:55,712
I doubt I’ll be able to erase
the complicated feelings I have

44
00:04:55,795 --> 00:05:00,341
towards Trapnest’s Ren unless
I make it big with my singing career.

45
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,511
But the reason

46
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:07,140
I always end up letting things
like this happen when we meet

47
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,143
is because I love him.

48
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,438
It’s as simple as that.

49
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,109
The strawberry glasses weren’t
in the kitchen cupboard.

50
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,614
I couldn’t imagine Hachi taking
my glass too,

51
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,826
so I figured
the glass must’ve broken after all,

52
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:30,079
which made me feel uneasy.

53
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:38,463
-Actually, both glasses were broken.
-Huh?

54
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,256
Takumi told me.

55
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:44,302
He said, "Your woman is terribly brutal.
You’ve gotta discipline her."

56
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,220
Discipline me?

57
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,307
When Hachiko saw them broken,
she was so shocked she started crying.

58
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,976
Takumi apparently had a tough time
trying to calm her down.

59
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:58,024
Given the situation, it’s normal to think
that you broke them out of anger.

60
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,359
In reality, it’s not likely that
both would break by accident.

61
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,781
It’s natural that Hachi would wanna
move out without saying anything.

62
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,619
All the more if those glasses
were precious to her.

63
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,455
It’s more than enough
to give her the message

64
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,290
that you’re ending your relationship.

65
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,461
What am I gonna do?
That wasn’t my intention at all.

66
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,297
-Then what was your intention?
-I don’t know.

67
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,008
You really don’t remember?

68
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,927
And you don’t remember putting
your phone in the water.

69
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,971
Sorry. And after you went to the trouble
of getting that phone for me.

70
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,349
-Something was wrong with me.
-It’s all right.

71
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:35,311
If you need a cell phone,
we can buy another one.

72
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:39,774
But I lost all the phone numbers
and email addresses I had.

73
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,526
I should’ve kept a list.

74
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:47,240
Well, the few friends you have
are mostly my friends too, so…

75
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,533
wanna copy the numbers?

76
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,201
That’s right.

77
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:52,912
It needs to be recharged.

78
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,166
Charge it right now!

79
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,169
No, I have to get going.

80
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,797
You’re practicing again
at the studio tonight too, right?

81
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,632
Ask the guys directly when you’re there.

82
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,468
But I’ve gotta call her right away.

83
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,097
Rather than calling her, go see her.

84
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,142
Hachi’s struggling with morning sickness,
and it’s raining.

85
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,476
She‘s probably home.

86
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,769
SHIROGANE 7-CHOME, MINATO-KU

87
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:22,733
Shirogane… 302?
That’s the same number as Ren’s place.

88
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,031
Ren! Give me a ride to the station!

89
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,158
To Shirogane-dai station?

90
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,327
No, the station over there.
I’ve gotta buy those glasses.

91
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:41,711
No matter how many times I think it over,
I can’t get over how careless I was.

92
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,715
But with the rain getting stronger

93
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,468
and the restlessness of not
having an umbrella

94
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,723
added to the anxiety of wanting
to hurry and see Hachiko…

95
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,703
How lucky!
Is this the rain of good fortune?

96
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:23,961
The trigger that alters someone’s fate
can be pulled in an instant.

97
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,515
2:40 P.M.

98
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,893
Hello, Mrs. Ichinose.

99
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,228
Are you going out?

100
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,813
Yes. Can you please call a taxi for me?

101
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,774
Certainly. Where to?

102
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,068
To the Shirogane-dai station.

103
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,919
This isn’t good. I don’t have a clue.

104
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:09,340
It should be somewhere around here.
Twenty minutes from the station?

105
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,676
I feel like I’ve been walking for an hour.

106
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,678
Excuse me.

107
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,681
I need to get to this address.
Would you know the way?

108
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,506
CALL

109
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,344
I should just act normally,
as if nothing ever happened.

110
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,390
Hachi thinks that I’m taking Nobu’s side
and am therefore furious,

111
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,684
taking a stand for justice…

112
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,855
because she thinks of me as some hero.

113
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:10,651
So I must teach her that a true hero
always stands by the heroine,

114
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,486
no matter what happens.

115
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,363
&lrm;CALL

116
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,575
Sorry, Nobu.

117
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,299
I WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU
UNTIL SEVEN O’CLOCK

118
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,842
AT THE TICKET GATE
OF SHIROGANE-DAI STATION. NANA

119
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,513
Um, excuse me.

120
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,891
It seems that the person
I’ve come to see is not here.

121
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,727
Can you please give this to her
when she returns?

122
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,273
Of course.
Whom is it to, and which suite number?

123
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,150
Suite 302…

124
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,655
Suite 302 is presently vacant.

125
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,283
Could you have the wrong suite number?

126
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:08,584
302 is the same number as Ren’s place.

127
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,296
I definitely don’t have the wrong number.

128
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,472
Excuse me.

129
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,225
Smoking is not permitted
in the restaurant.

130
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,320
Nana Komatsu?

131
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,573
There’s no one by that name living here.

132
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,868
That’s impossible!
She just moved here recently!

133
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,329
Why, of course. It’s under Takumi’s name.

134
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,705
What’s Takumi’s surname?

135
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,332
Or is Takumi his real name to begin with?

136
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,209
I have no idea what Takumi’s real name is!

137
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,754
Takumi of Trapnest and his woman
live in suite 302, don’t they?

138
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,673
There’s no use hiding it. I already know.

139
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,675
There’s no one living here
who matches that description.

140
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,886
Excuse me, but could you please leave?

141
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,971
DO NOT ACCEPT MESSAGES FROM ANY VISITORS
WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT.

142
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,975
Damn it!

143
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:10,062
I bet that guy mistook me
for a fan of Takumi.

144
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,647
Of all people, Takumi!

145
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:16,318
Suite 302 is presently vacant.

146
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,113
A peremptory measure.

147
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:22,324
Takumi would think of that kind
of method to get rid of someone.

148
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,622
Sure, if confronted in that way,
many would think they made a mistake.

149
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,749
People will believe it is a vacant room,

150
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,668
and Hachi, living her life here carefree,

151
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:36,881
would be like a ghost,
unaware that she is already dead.

152
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:41,635
She’d exist only for Takumi
and the child she’s having.

153
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:46,932
Hey, Hachi, are you really fine with that?

154
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,893
What? You’re getting married?

155
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,020
Yes.

156
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,105
Are you pregnant?

157
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,940
You’re really good
at figuring out such things.

158
00:12:55,024 --> 00:13:00,029
That’s the only reason that comes to mind
that would lead Takumi to propose.

159
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,532
But is it really Takumi’s child?

160
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,994
Probably.

161
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,664
Have an abortion.

162
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,834
You should tell Takumi the truth
and break up with him.

163
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,836
The thought that you’ll earn happiness
just by getting married

164
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,963
is only an illusion.

165
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,132
Of course, Takumi knows everything.

166
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,801
He knows, and he’s still marrying you?
That sounds unbelievable!

167
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,638
Huh? But, well, I can go through with this

168
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:29,725
because we accept each other
even after knowing stuff about that.

169
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:35,189
Am I weird?
And Takumi is a weird person too.

170
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:43,447
No. I don’t really know what’s weird
and what’s not about anything,

171
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,033
so don’t worry about anything I say.

172
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,914
You think maybe your family situation
has some similarities

173
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,916
with the position I’m in now?

174
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,212
I think the reason people are keeping
my situation a secret from only you is,

175
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:01,924
of course partly because
they don’t wanna talk about me,

176
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,052
but I think it’s also
because they don’t wanna open up

177
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,054
any scars you have from the past.

178
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,183
I also intended to keep it
a secret from you,

179
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,103
because I knew you would be
against me keeping it.

180
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,480
But then I thought that’s all
the more reason why

181
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,649
I should tell you everything.

182
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:23,237
I’m sure your mother went
through a lot of agony like I did

183
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,448
but still wanted to have you, Shin.

184
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,619
I know that much.
Stop treating me like a child.

185
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,288
I’M SORRY

186
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,958
Then I want to hear from you

187
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:42,256
what made you feel that your mother
should never have given birth to you.

188
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:47,219
I don’t ever want my own child
saying something like that.

189
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:54,977
But if the child is not Takumi’s,
I’m sure that would be agonizing for him.

190
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,229
And the child
would eventually think it strange

191
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,316
if they don’t look alike
or their blood types are different.

192
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,779
But even so, I believe we can still be
a happy family if we try,

193
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,615
or at least I’d like to at least hope so.

194
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:12,411
-Am I being naive?
-I think so.

195
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,665
But really, don’t mind what I say.

196
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,918
Even if there are some similarities,

197
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,962
things will be different
if the people involved are different.

198
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,423
You’ve just gotta do what
you believe is right.

199
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,469
Yeah. I’m sorry.

200
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,310
I wish I’d been born as your child, Hachi.

201
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:52,993
Shinichi Okazaki’s mother took her life
shortly after Shin was born.

202
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:57,539
The truth about Shin’s biological father
may be lost forever.

203
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,793
I can investigate further if you wish,
but you’ve gotta realize

204
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,004
it’s a case about one individual,
and it happened overseas.

205
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,924
No, this is more than enough
for a great story.

206
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,761
I’d rather have you investigate
the whereabouts of Nana’s mother.

207
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,388
Thank you as usual.

208
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,309
But unless BLAST becomes big,
won’t this go to waste?

209
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,771
Just watch. There’s no doubt about it.
They’ll be big.

210
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,065
But it appears that Gaia has
no intention of letting them debut.

211
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,359
I’ll make it happen.

212
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,903
Even if they were to debut,
they won’t sell.

213
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,322
A visually attractive band
may attract fad followers,

214
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,366
but that will repel the real music lovers.

215
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,494
-And these songs aren’t what--
-Stop talking like some music critic!

216
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,497
What the people want never changes!

217
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,124
They want a stimulating topic!

218
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,917
And yet the young brats of today
just don’t get it.

219
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,169
They all believe they’re great artists.

220
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,714
It makes me sick.

221
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:51,760
A world where "honor student" bands
like Trapnest reign is as sleepy as hell!

222
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,930
I would just love to break that nose
of Takumi that he proudly sticks up high.

223
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,851
Anyway, I look forward
to tomorrow’s party.

224
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,936
We’ll open everyone’s eyes.

225
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,105
Huh? But Search isn’t on the shelves
until the day after tomorrow, right?

226
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,858
I sold half of the information
to TV networks.

227
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:09,278
They were really into my scenario
and practically handed over their wallets.

228
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,405
It wasn’t about getting a scoop, huh?

229
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,408
My objective is to increase
magazine sales!

230
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,327
Get the people excited with news
about their love affair,

231
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,621
and the people will jump
at the precious photo!

232
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,499
You got a picture of them together?

233
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,003
It looks great.

234
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:34,053
That day, I waited for Hachi
in front of her place until sunset,

235
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,179
but I couldn’t see her.

236
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,555
TRAIN TICKET MACHINE
210 YEN

237
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,642
I’ll come again tomorrow after work.

238
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,104
I have a little time
before I go to the studio.

239
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,648
I’ll get her phone number from Yasu,

240
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,484
so we don’t miss each other
like this again.

241
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,862
It’s not like I’ll never see her again.

242
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,323
There’s always tomorrow.

243
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,993
Sorry to keep you for so long.

244
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,204
I’m so glad we got the chance
to talk about all kinds of stuff.

245
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,165
Housewives are craving
for the chance to talk to people.

246
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,585
Don’t remain at home thinking only
about the baby in your tummy.

247
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,629
You need to get in touch
with the outside world.

248
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:14,468
But the only plans I have to go out
are for shopping and checkups.

249
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,011
Why don’t you take courses on something?

250
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,387
You’d also make housewife friends
that way.

251
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,724
Great idea.
Good luck with your practice, Shin.

252
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,477
Personally, I think some things
are impossible to achieve,

253
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,895
no matter how much you practice.

254
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,480
That’s not true!

255
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:29,733
I believe that BLAST will become
the best band in Japan someday!

256
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:36,615
Well then, madame, we’ll meet again
when your husband’s not around.

257
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,533
Yes.

258
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,175
Shin!

259
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,353
How is Nobu?

260
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:17,614
He keeps playing his guitar!
It’s so noisy I can’t get any sleep!

261
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,665
I can’t wait until dawn.

262
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,419
I hope it’ll be sunny tomorrow.

263
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,635
Ouch!

264
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,721
Oh, sorry. You’re home.

265
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,312
Seven o’clock?

266
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:52,357
He just got to bed. I’m amazed how
he can get up and go to work.

267
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,627
What are you watching a video
of yourself so early in the morning?

268
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:16,256
-No. We’re on TV.
-Oh, how nice.

269
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,758
Is this "Channel Nana"?

270
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,885
Wake up! There is no such channel!

271
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,595
MORNING 7

272
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,932
Good morning! It’s time for Morning 7!

273
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,391
We've learned
about the passionate love affair

274
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,726
of Trapnest’s guitarist, Ren!

275
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,063
She's a member of his former band
and the vocalist of the "Black Stones,"

276
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:35,150
a band on the brink
of a major debut with Gaia Records.

277
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,276
Her name is Nana!

278
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,285
Ever since that day
when the thick clouds passed

279
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,413
and I was suddenly in the spotlight…

280
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:54,878
The place we were standing was
not a stage but the center of a ring.

281
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:03,804
I can still hear the cheers
and jeers ringing in my head,

282
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,056
loud and annoying…
