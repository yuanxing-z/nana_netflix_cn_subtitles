1
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:08,967
I felt like such a fool
for not noticing until now.

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,929
For example, the number of piercings
they each had and the way they talked.

3
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:15,432
Nana and Ren were so much alike.

4
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:18,059
It gave me a sense
of the deep history they had together.

5
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:35,744
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

6
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,041
"What is that padlock
you’re always wearing?"

7
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:10,505
"I can’t take it off
because I lost the key," he says.

8
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:16,719
I wonder. Maybe Nana has
the key to Ren’s padlock.

9
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,725
Ever since I found out that Ren
of Trapnest is Nana’s ex-boyfriend,

10
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,854
I took out all the music magazines
and fan-club notices I had kept

11
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,523
and read them thoroughly, over and over.

12
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,734
I was stunned to realize
how I had just been skimming

13
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,903
through the articles until now.

14
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:39,826
I’m clearly the type who only cares
to read what I’m interested in.

15
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:48,167
In fact, right now, my mind is
full of Nana and Ren,

16
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,920
and I can barely think of anything else…

17
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,093
even though I’m purposely making
an effort not to think of anything else.

18
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,766
The other thing is,
if I find a new boyfriend,

19
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,686
I’m sure I’ll stop thinking about Shoji.

20
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,982
It would be nice
for such a day to come soon.

21
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,776
Hey, are you ready?

22
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,531
Shall we get going?

23
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,367
Mm-hmm.

24
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,038
Hey… hey, Nana.

25
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,414
Aren’t you getting changed?

26
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,415
Why?

27
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,500
Are you going to the concert
dressed like that?

28
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,462
It’s part of our overnight journey.

29
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,547
The more comfortable the outfit,
the better, right?

30
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,548
Say, aren’t these nice?

31
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:39,510
Y-- Yes, but we’ve been looking forward
to this concert,

32
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,804
so shouldn’t we dress up a bit?

33
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,557
You’re meeting Ren
for the first time in two years!

34
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,560
You’re the one who’s been
looking forward to this.

35
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,896
Why should I also have to dress up?

36
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,774
It’s only a Trapnest concert.

37
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,026
First of all,
if she wears those sunglasses,

38
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,904
Ren might not recognize her.

39
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,908
Is she doing this on purpose?

40
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,745
Damn, there are a ton of things
I want to ask and say to her.

41
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,288
Is this ok?

42
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,751
However, right now, my top priority
is getting Nana to the concert.

43
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,295
I should be careful
not to be too demanding.

44
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,436
Want another sugar for yours?

45
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,521
I won’t be using any.

46
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,398
-N-- No, I’m fine.
-Okay.

47
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,619
The distance between Nana and Ren
is getting closer and closer.

48
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,372
-I can’t wait to see them.
-Huh?

49
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,124
Your family.

50
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,961
Especially Natsuko. I’m a big fan of hers.

51
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,880
I’m not too comfortable
about having you meet them.

52
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:04,762
My parents are no more
than your typical countryside folks.

53
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,015
My younger sister still
wears that dark makeup…

54
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,434
And my elder sister…

55
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,435
Nana!

56
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,687
She’s gained even more weight.

57
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,149
They’re identical.

58
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,863
Sorry for making you go through
the trouble of picking us up.

59
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:22,905
"Go through the trouble"?

60
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,617
Don’t mention it. My workplace is
closed today, so I was available.

61
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,496
In this area, you can't
get anywhere without a car.

62
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,916
By the way, Nao,
could you drive us to the concert?

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,209
Sure. Where is it?

64
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,463
At the Idea Hall.
I wanna be there around six.

65
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,340
Then we should leave at around 5:30 p.m.

66
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,677
Yes! Thank you! I love you, Nao!

67
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,440
Nana, look! It’s my old specialty college!

68
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,818
It brings back memories.

69
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,071
Brings back memories?

70
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,823
But you commuted there
until only a year ago, right?

71
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,035
Oh right. But it feels like ten years ago.

72
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,328
What are you saying?

73
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,581
Art school, right? Was it fun?

74
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,584
Mm-hmm. I knew I didn’t have
much talent in that area,

75
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:21,089
but every day was so much fun.
With Jun-chan and Kyosuke and…

76
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,596
We hung out together, every day.

77
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,519
Oh, Nana. You know, Nami was telling me…

78
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,562
Are you really living with your boyfriend?

79
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,272
It’s that guy, right?

80
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,901
The guy who often came by the house
while you were in art school… Shoji.

81
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,820
-No!
-I believe you’re misunderstanding.

82
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,656
I am Nana’s roommate.

83
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,824
Oh? Really?

84
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,119
You know, why don’t you all come
and visit us sometime?

85
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,663
If you see, you’ll understand.

86
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:57,959
What? That Nami, going around
spreading rumors again.

87
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,503
She’s gotta be more careful.

88
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,672
I’m glad Nana’s with me.

89
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:07,718
This place has too many memories
for me to visit alone.

90
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:14,475
We’re back! Mom! Nana’s here!

91
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,937
Wow, what a grand house!
You’re quite the princess.

92
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,023
Not really. This is normal.
Land is really cheap around here.

93
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,195
Welcome home, Nana!

94
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,613
-How tan!
-Did you get me a gift?

95
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,531
Like a Louis Vuitton bag?

96
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,158
Tokyo is not a foreign country, you know!

97
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,661
Hey! Nami, behave yourself
in front of our guest.

98
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,206
Hello, I’m Nana’s mother.

99
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,376
You may find it hard to relax here,
but please make yourself at home.

100
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,425
Pleased to meet you. I’m Nana Osaki.
Thank you for the hospitality.

101
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,718
Nana?

102
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,179
That’s right. We have the same name.

103
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,847
But Nana’s name is written
in katakana characters.

104
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,057
Isn’t she totally pretty?

105
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,518
It’s amazing how different two people
with the same name can be.

106
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,686
Mom!

107
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,063
I pity you, my daughter.

108
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,482
Way to go, Natsuko!

109
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,275
You’re laughing too much, Nami!

110
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,069
Nami, I found out
you’re talking nonsense again.

111
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,822
Apparently, Nana lives with Nana.

112
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,365
-What?
-What?

113
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,409
Why? What about your boyfriend?

114
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,994
Again, you’re misunderstanding!

115
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,330
Are you serious? That’s no fun.

116
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,333
Then why didn’t you tell us
in the first place?

117
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,043
You’re a source of constant worry.

118
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,044
I told you,

119
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,087
-but you wouldn’t listen, Mom.
-So you’re living with my daughter.

120
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:29,425
I can only imagine how much trouble
she’s causing. I’m really sorry.

121
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:34,013
No, Nana is honest, cheerful and kind.

122
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,681
Living with her encourages me.

123
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,309
As I imagined,

124
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,937
I can see she’s been brought up
in a very warm family environment.

125
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,563
You certainly know
the right things to say.

126
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,315
-Ouch!
-You still have time, right?

127
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,733
-Why don’t I make some tea?
-Nana…

128
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,109
Here are some Japanese sweets…

129
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,991
-Nana, you’re such a good actress.
-Huh?

130
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,994
"Nana is honest, cheerful and kind?"

131
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,871
I really believe that.

132
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,957
She encourages me.

133
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,087
By the way, where’s your dad?
Does he work Saturdays too?

134
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,756
Ah, yeah. He’ll be back in the evening.

135
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,467
Then I can meet him.
I’m looking forward to it.

136
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,096
He’s not a father worth
getting your hopes up for.

137
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,682
Or rather, I’m sorry.
My family can be so noisy.

138
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,599
I’m embarrassed.

139
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,477
No, I’m really enjoying it.

140
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,187
Natsuko’s better than I imagined.

141
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,272
Meeting her was such a thrill.

142
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,400
What’s so great about her?
She’s just a normal lady.

143
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,319
No, that’s a quality you don’t see much.

144
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,654
She is the ideal mother.

145
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,156
Really? Then what about your mom, Nana?

146
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,702
What kind of person is she?
I bet she's pretty and cool.

147
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,831
I wonder. I can barely remember.

148
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,416
What do you mean?

149
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,168
You’ve only been away from
your hometown for less than half a year.

150
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,171
No, I haven’t seen her since I was four.

151
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,507
Huh? Why not?

152
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,342
She ran off with a guy.

153
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,971
She could even be dead now.

154
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,432
Not that I care.

155
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:03,978
Then, Nana, it was just
you and your father?

156
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,563
Do you have any siblings?

157
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,690
No.

158
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,027
Actually, I never had a father
to start with.

159
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,238
I was raised by my mother’s mother.

160
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,700
But my grandma died when I was 15.

161
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,454
That’s why I find this so attractive.

162
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,874
The atmosphere of belonging
to a loving family like yours.

163
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,585
Since I never had one, this is fun.

164
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,963
Attractive? But Nana…

165
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,843
To me, this is normal.

166
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,769
Sorry… for talking about a gloomy subject.

167
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,897
No, I was just a bit surprised.

168
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,900
Sorry for asking you so many questions
without giving it much thought.

169
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,569
But I’m glad.

170
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,324
Oh, no, that came out wrong! Sorry.
I’m not glad about what happened.

171
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,660
-That part really shocked me!
-Calm down.

172
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:08,084
Nana. You've never talked to me
about yourself until now,

173
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,336
so I would wonder why that is.

174
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:14,090
It made me sad wondering about it.

175
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,594
So I’m glad you shared that with me.

176
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,098
I see. Sorry.

177
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:26,936
It never occurred to me
that you might be feeling like that.

178
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:32,858
I never had a close female friend
until now,

179
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,320
so I don’t know how
to spend time together.

180
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:40,574
I’m not good at talking about myself.

181
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,868
So I end up not talking about things.

182
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,878
But just ask me, and I’ll tell you
anything you want, okay?

183
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,964
So stop feeling sad.

184
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,471
What’s so funny?

185
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,808
Because Nana, why are you
always acting like a cool guy?

186
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,395
You’re more like a boyfriend to me
than a female friend.

187
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,022
You just took my breath away right now.

188
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,650
No, I can’t have you
feel that way about me.

189
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,697
You’ll really tell me anything
I want, right?

190
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,700
-Yeah.
-And promise to be frank with me.

191
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,076
Yeah.

192
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,663
Do you still love Ren?

193
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,047
You knew.

194
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,720
I’m sorry.
Acting as if I didn’t know. But…

195
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:46,056
You brought me here knowing, right?

196
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,517
Thank you.

197
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,564
Nana.

198
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,849
Nana, I wanna buy a poster
and stuff. What about you?

199
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,270
I’ll have a smoke and then go to my seat.

200
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,856
Show me your poster later.

201
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,692
Do you still love Ren?

202
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,823
Nana ended up not answering that question.

203
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:52,122
However, I could tell
even without her telling me.

204
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,171
The word love…

205
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:03,968
If you were able to say
that word with ease,

206
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,136
you would’ve already
gone to see him long ago.

207
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,115
We’re smack in front of the guitarist.

208
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,950
You have the best seat in the house, Nana!

209
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,623
The stage is much closer
to the seats than I expected.

210
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,294
What’ll I do? I’m already
on the verge of crying.

211
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,338
Though there’s no reason for me to cry.

212
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,515
But rather than choose
happiness as a woman,

213
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,058
she chose to protect her pride.

214
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,478
Nana.

215
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:06,322
Ladies and gentlemen,
the event is about to begin.

216
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,449
If you are yet to be seated,

217
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,243
please promptly make your way
to your seats.

218
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:24,548
Now that we have our band members,
all we need is a band name.

219
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,925
What will it be?

220
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,093
Why don’t we keep the band name
we had before?

221
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,470
There’s nothing wrong with Brute.

222
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,680
That’s so lame. Sounds too barbaric.

223
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,933
You’re the one who came up with the name.

224
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,644
Yes, but I want to start fresh.

225
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,396
We finally have a pretty girl on vocals,

226
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,856
so we can’t have
anything barbaric, can we?

227
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,858
Right.

228
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,655
Then what about Olive? Popeye’s girl.

229
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,782
Does Olive match your image? I think not.

230
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,660
Same goes for you. And me.

231
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:56,330
Nana, stop laughing and help us think.

232
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,084
Anything you come up with is fine with me.

233
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:03,629
Hey, are you serious
about being the vocalist of the band?

234
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,090
Anything is fine with me.

235
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,800
Can you say you’re enjoying life,

236
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,093
the way you take on everything
with that slanted attitude?

237
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,137
I never said, "Anything is fine with me."

238
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,183
Then give it some thought.
Give some input into the band.

239
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,520
This coming from the most
self-centered member of the band.

240
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,942
What about this? This is nice.
"Black Stone".

241
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,611
Don’t just pick the first thing you see.

242
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,781
But it’s cool.
I’ve never seen anything like it.

243
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,951
Are those any good?
They have a strong scent.

244
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,537
Yeah, they’re good.
They’re actually cigars.

245
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,789
I made a trade
with a tobacco shop owner for them.

246
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,374
-A trade?
-A trade?

247
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,585
-Yuck! What’s this? Such a weird taste!
-Really?

248
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:48,465
But not bad. Black Stone.
BLAST for short. That’s easy to say.

249
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,843
Yeah, that’s nice. "BLAST".

250
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,636
He took my cigarette.

251
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,096
-Yuck!
-What the…

252
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,683
You know, BLAST also
means a strong gust of wind.

253
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,642
Really?

254
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,270
That’s great! That’s kinda cool that
we shorten the name,

255
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,604
and it also means something!

256
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,231
Should we go with that then?

257
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:07,026
We’re a band of four,
so let’s go with "Black Stones".

258
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,778
It’s an odd name,
but we’re an odd band, so it kinda fits.

259
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,405
Agreed! Hurray for BLAST!

260
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,865
Okay, it’s decided.

261
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,367
So, leader,
how about a celebration speech?

262
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,910
They really went with it.

263
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:21,915
Well then, band members,
an order from your leader.

264
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,169
From this day on, we’ll all
smoke this brand of cigarettes.

265
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,463
-Smoke them yourself!
-Smoke them yourself!

266
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,036
Reira!

267
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,797
Why… am I crying?

268
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,010
But my heart’s filled with emotion.

269
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,065
Nana…

270
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:39,947
That night, I had repeatedly prayed
so hard that the destiny waiting

271
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:44,201
for Nana after this
would be one of happiness.

272
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:52,251
That time, I wanted to continue
holding that hand

273
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,254
that I didn't know I was holding.

274
00:20:56,672 --> 00:21:00,092
Always, forever.
