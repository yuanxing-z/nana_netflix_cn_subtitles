FROM NANA

2
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:05,964
The moment I saw that empty room,

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:13,638
I felt that I had become lost
in a lonely world where only I existed.

4
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:42,167
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

5
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,698
What? She moved?

6
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,909
Mm-hmm. She says she lives
a lot farther away,

7
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,577
so she doesn’t think she can come by much.

8
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,579
She asked me to give her best
to everyone here at Jackson’s.

9
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,164
Wait a minute.
What’s that supposed to mean?

10
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,499
That’s making me feel really lonely.

11
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,626
Who moved?

12
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,962
Nana. She moved to Shirogane.

13
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,297
Why Shirogane, all of a sudden?

14
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,759
Minami Aoyama, Hiroo, Azabu.

15
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,512
Each one of those properties
were spectacular as well.

16
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,888
They’re all in really expensive districts!

17
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:23,434
But I thought right from the beginning
that Nana would choose Shirogane.

18
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,352
Why’s that?

19
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,980
Because it’s the place that
young wives dream about.

20
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,481
Young wives?

21
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:32,026
She probably wants to be one
of the "Housewives of Shirogane."

22
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,487
What the…

23
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,115
Personally, I’m a bit relieved.

24
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,367
I’m looking forward to seeing Nana
in a wedding dress.

25
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,619
Even if she’s doing it
for her child’s sake,

26
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,247
I can’t understand how she could marry
a guy she doesn’t even love.

27
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,417
No, if she didn’t love him,
she wouldn’t do it.

28
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,379
-But what about Nobu?
-She probably loves them both.

29
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,591
That’s something
you can relate to, isn’t it?

30
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,717
I’m home!

31
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,678
Huh? You’re here, Shoji.

32
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,598
So you’ve finally run out of money
to drink at Jackson’s?

33
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,850
A toast to Nana,
who’s marrying a rich guy.

34
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:04,767
So you heard.

35
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,854
Although she probably wouldn’t want you
to celebrate it.

36
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:13,818
But how rich is this guy,
who can afford a million-yen rent?

37
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,612
No, it’s 700,000 yen.

38
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:21,159
She persuaded him to save some
of the rent money for the child.

39
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,077
Nana’s starting to mature.

40
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,330
That’s the strength of becoming
a mother, I guess.

41
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,582
But even 700,000 yen is plenty expensive!

42
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,627
-Who is this guy?
-He’s a musician.

43
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,173
Someone close to that guru again?

44
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,092
I guess. He’s Yasu’s friend, I hear.

45
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,137
If it’s one of Yasu’s friends,
there’s no need to worry.

46
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,682
But for him to have that much income
would mean, unlike BLAST,

47
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,267
this guy’s a professional musician, right?

48
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,644
Is he famous?

49
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:51,898
No, one would have to be a major star
to make that much in music.

50
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,609
He’s likely some carefree son
of a rich family.

51
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:58,905
Besides, why would a famous star
want to marry someone like Nana?

52
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,115
Also, with how excited Nana gets
when it comes to celebrities,

53
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,284
there’s no way she would’ve kept quiet
about it if he were even a little famous.

54
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:07,747
But maybe she’s forced to keep it
a secret because he’s a celebrity!

55
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,873
Huh?

56
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,333
-What’s his name?
-Takumi.

57
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,002
Takumi is so cool!

58
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,671
Of Trapnest?

59
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,509
That’s impossible! Are you dumb?

60
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:28,142
-Why are you following me?
-See ya.

61
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,144
Why not? I’ll leave right away!

62
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,898
-Just let me get a glimpse of Hachiko!
-All right.

63
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,360
Welcome home.

64
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,737
This place is nice. Is it a new building?

65
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,198
The rent is very reasonable
for the space, right?

66
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,075
It's because you have to walk
a bit from the train station.

67
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,868
You never use the train anyway.

68
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,537
This is nice. Like a hidden residence.

69
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,417
Is it your first time to this place, too?

70
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,252
Because we were confined
to the studio the whole time?

71
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,255
No. I came to see this place once
when I signed the contract.

72
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,381
Really?

73
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:02,760
I needed to check the neighborhood
and the security system,

74
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,095
or else I’d be worried.

75
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,555
Hello?

76
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,056
I’m home.

77
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,392
Ah, um… Welcome home!

78
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,979
She’s tripping on her words.
She’s too cute.

79
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,024
-You seem to be having fun, Takumi.
-Because we’re newlyweds.

80
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,234
But you’re not legally married yet.

81
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,153
Are you really serious
about getting married?

82
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,488
You’re still renting the place
in Akasaka too, right?

83
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,489
Are you planning to live separately?

84
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,326
Shut up. I’ll move out of
that place eventually.

85
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,744
Eventually?

86
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,835
There’s an auto-lock on each floor too.
Talk about high security.

87
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:41,674
I’m seldom at home, so this is
to ensure the safety of my wife and child.

88
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,635
Especially since you have
many extreme fans.

89
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,014
Why are they so fixated
on chasing an illusion?

90
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,892
-I have trouble understanding it.
-It’s because it’s an illusion!

91
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:57,648
In reality, there is no person
who would do exactly as you’d wish.

92
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,029
But Takumi, you are getting married
to a woman whom

93
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,989
you have trouble understanding, right?

94
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,866
I have trouble understanding that.

95
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:12,622
Nana knows that reality and illusions
are two different things.

96
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,500
She knows that, and she still dreams
without getting discouraged.

97
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,626
That’s what’s so cute about her.

98
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,087
Then Hachiko and I are the same!

99
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,881
So that makes me cute, too! Right, Takumi?

100
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,382
I wanna smack him.

101
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,762
-Yes?
-I’m home.

102
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,514
What am I gonna do?

103
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,516
I’m getting nervous.

104
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,434
Please don’t stay long.

105
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,269
Don’t intrude on our first night
as newlyweds.

106
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,772
But you’re not newlyweds,
and it’s not your first night together.

107
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,236
-Welcome home!
-Hi. Good evening.

108
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,362
Who is this guy?

109
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,033
Good evening…

110
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,243
NAOKI

111
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,744
Hachiko’s so cute!

112
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,746
If you’re satisfied, go home.

113
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,669
This place is like a castle!

114
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,337
What part?

115
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,716
You must be exhausted from your recording.

116
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,009
How thoughtful of you.

117
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,846
If it’s not inconvenient,
won’t you stay for dinner?

118
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,556
-Yes!
-Don’t bother.

119
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,182
He’ll be leaving right away.

120
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,603
Then I’ll have dinner ready right away.

121
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,605
I got carried away and prepared too much,

122
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,524
so it would be a great help
if you’d eat with us.

123
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,110
Yes.

124
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,027
MORNING SICKNESS COUNTERMEASURE

125
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,037
Wow! Thanks for the food!

126
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,664
Delicious!

127
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,958
Yeah? I’m glad.

128
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,960
You’re a great cook, just like I’d heard.

129
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,463
No wonder he’d want you as his wife.

130
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,257
That’s not why I decided to marry her.

131
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,718
If that’s what I wanted,
a housekeeper would have been fine.

132
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:53,598
But there aren’t many girls
who can cook like this.

133
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,808
On top of that,
it must’ve been a lot of work

134
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,060
to make this place so livable
so soon after moving.

135
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:03,524
Actually, I had a professional coordinator
do the interior design before I moved in.

136
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,527
But I found it difficult to express
the image I had in mind,

137
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,488
so it ended up looking a bit over the top.

138
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,489
I see.

139
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,283
We can gradually change things as we like.

140
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,993
Speaking of which,

141
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,870
what about the furniture
you were using at your last place?

142
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:20,416
-Did you throw them away?
-No. I put them all in a room for now.

143
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,587
-Your private room?
-No, I plan to make that the baby’s room.

144
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,672
I can use a lot of my furniture as is.

145
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,009
I even had the wallpaper changed,
and the room looks so cute now!

146
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,678
-I wanna see it!
-Take a look!

147
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,933
-So cute!
-Isn’t it?

148
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,476
Thank you, Mama!

149
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,435
A flower pattern?

150
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,021
There’s nothing wrong with that.
It looks really cute.

151
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,272
Like a princess’ room.

152
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,650
What if it’s a boy?

153
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:51,906
What’ll we do?
I felt so sure that it’s gonna be a girl.

154
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,075
Then I’m sure it will be a girl.

155
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,869
I don’t understand how
you could be so sure.

156
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,455
I’m sorry. I got carried away.

157
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,084
Don’t worry.
Wallpaper can be changed anytime.

158
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,963
And we can keep trying
until we have a girl.

159
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,589
Geez…

160
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:14,345
Well then… I guess I’ll be going now.

161
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,975
Just ask at the front desk,
and they’ll call you a taxi.

162
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,434
Yeah. Thanks for having me over.

163
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,562
And thanks for the great meal, Nana.

164
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,230
Please come again anytime, okay?

165
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,232
I’ll come when Takumi’s not around.

166
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,985
No way! That would be a problem!

167
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:34,740
Naoki’s really funny.
I never imagined him to be so outgoing.

168
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,325
I think we could get along.
That makes me happy.

169
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,788
Really? He made me super exhausted.
Fill up the tub for me, will you?

170
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,665
Oh, I did that already.

171
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:48,129
You don’t need to try
and be the perfect wife.

172
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,423
Let’s take a bath together and relax.

173
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,800
I can’t relax doing that.

174
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,679
Did you lose weight?

175
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,433
Mm-hmm. About three kilos.

176
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,935
Is your morning sickness that bad?

177
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,314
But I’ve been feeling a lot better
these past two, three days,

178
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,608
perhaps because of the change
in atmosphere after moving.

179
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:12,111
Besides, I was getting a bit chubby,
so it’s perfect now.

180
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,779
I guess so.

181
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,451
I’m sure you’ll get chubby again
once the morning sickness is over.

182
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,746
-No way!
-I’ll bet you’ll become really fat.

183
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,999
What’ll I do?
In fact, I tend to gain weight easily!

184
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,792
My mom and older sister are both chubby,

185
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,713
and my younger sister goes through
great effort to maintain her great figure.

186
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,549
-How many siblings do you have?
-Two!

187
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,843
-Both girls?
-Mm-hmm!

188
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:39,555
-Wow, that’s kind of scary.
-There’s nothing scary about it.

189
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,099
My older sister is
as kind as a bodhisattva.

190
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,309
Did you talk to your parents?

191
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,814
Yeah. I called my mom.

192
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,275
How much did you tell her?

193
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:58,658
That I’m pregnant, so I might get married.

194
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:03,412
What do you mean "might"?
Can’t you trust me?

195
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,082
-But…
-Oh well.

196
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,584
And what did Mommy say?

197
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,712
Mommy? M-- Mommy said…

198
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:15,841
Oh, really? Congratulations. You did well.

199
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,053
-Like that.
-What kind of mom is that?

200
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,430
She’s that kind of mom.

201
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,392
But I’ll bet your dad
is furious, isn’t he?

202
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,559
Not really.

203
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,479
Right after that call, he called me.

204
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,522
Rather than be angry,

205
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:33,234
he just sighed and went on
about what a foolish daughter I am.

206
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,486
He asked me what kind of man you are,

207
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:39,115
so I told him that you work
in the music industry.

208
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,118
He works at a karaoke joint?
Is it all-you-can-sing?

209
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,036
That’s what he said.

210
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,791
So I summed it up and told him
that you write music and stuff.

211
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,418
Summed it up?

212
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,962
Because if they found out
it’s Takumi of Trapnest,

213
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:57,174
my younger sister will get all excited
and tell all her friends!

214
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,094
I haven’t even told
Jun-chan about this yet.

215
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,303
Jun-chan?

216
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,181
She takes care of me like a mother,
even more than my real mother.

217
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:08,102
She always lectures me,
but I feel her love for me.

218
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,396
Maybe Jun-chan’s the one
who gave birth to me.

219
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,107
There’s no need to be secretive about this
to the people close to you.

220
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,650
I do have permission from the agency.

221
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,573
We’ve decided to notify the media by fax
when the marriage becomes official.

222
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,200
Rather than trying to hide it,
it’s better to inform them

223
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:26,162
and request them not to make a fuss about
it because I’m marrying an ordinary girl.

224
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,331
I’ve kept this coming Sunday open,

225
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,459
so tell your parents that
I’ll be coming to meet them.

226
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:36,589
I’m hoping to discuss details
such as the wedding date then.

227
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,967
We should make it soon,
before your belly begins to show.

228
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,182
FROM: NAOKI
RE: REPORT

229
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,310
I went to check out
Takumi and Hachiko’s new home!

230
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:54,023
Hachiko is a cute and nice girl,
and Takumi is very kind to her.

231
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,774
I’m sure things will go well
between the two.

232
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,359
There’s nothing to worry about.

233
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,321
Good night. Heart.

234
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,115
You’re disturbing my sleep!

235
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,473
You’ll catch a cold.
Why don’t you smoke inside?

236
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,808
It’s all right. Just one cigarette.

237
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,270
I don’t wanna be hated
by the princess in your tummy.

238
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,359
It was really nice taking a bath together.

239
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,779
It resolves the lack of communication
we’ve had.

240
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,322
Let’s take a bath together again, okay?

241
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,367
You like doing it in small spaces?

242
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,453
You’ve gotta tell me
these important things.

243
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,274
SHIN

244
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,738
Oh, hello. Hachi?

245
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,575
Mm-hmm.

246
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,785
Sorry for calling this late.

247
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,829
You have to go to work
early tomorrow too, right?

248
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,208
No.

249
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,502
I’m not calling
about anything in particular.

250
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,379
It’s just that I haven’t seen you
since the fireworks

251
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,630
and was wondering how you’re doing.

252
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,092
The fireworks were fun, huh?

253
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:48,053
That was the first time
I had ever lit fireworks.

254
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:53,267
We wrote wishes on tanabata, too,
this summer.

255
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,394
Everything was so much fun.

256
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:02,151
Let’s light fireworks with everyone again.

257
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,528
Do you think they still sell them
at the convenience store?

258
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,868
I’m sorry, Shin.

259
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,161
What for?

260
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,831
Because I’m a traitor.

261
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,752
I can’t look you guys in the eyes anymore.

262
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,093
I’ll always be on your side,
no matter what, Hachi.

263
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,307
Nana, where’s the hair dryer?

264
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,565
I’m sorry, Jun-chan. Good night.

265
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,816
Found it.

266
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:56,413
What’s wrong? Did Jun-chan lecture
you about something?

267
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,004
I just got a bit homesick.

268
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,006
SEPTEMBER 10
8:32 P.M. HACHI

269
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,176
Don’t you ever mention that name again.

270
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:13,055
Even Nobu has a thing or two
he would rather not talk about.

271
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,515
SEPTEMBER 10
8:32 P.M. HACHI

272
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,520
So that’s what’s going on.

273
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,074
Because I’m a traitor.

274
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,036
I can’t look you guys in the eyes anymore.

275
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:42,543
I believe people are bound by trust.

276
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,257
I’m sorry.

277
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,802
Please give me Yasu’s cell number.

278
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,847
Reira was in love with Takumi.

279
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,310
Looking back, I know it was
just petty jealousy…

280
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,565
Yet I couldn’t support her
when she needed me the most.

281
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:09,820
But can't you support her now, Yasu?

282
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:14,950
Right now, my hands are full
taking care of you guys.

283
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,204
Shin!

284
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,497
Ren, you’re here!

285
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,749
You…

286
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,459
I hate to say this
since I haven’t seen you in a while,

287
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:27,463
but I have to leave again
right away. Sorry.

288
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,506
Can’t you at least be a little sorry?

289
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,135
Nana began crying all because of you.
It was a mess!

290
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,055
I’m sorry. I got angry, so…

291
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,307
That was childish of me, wasn’t it?

292
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,935
No, actually it’s Nana
who was acting childish.

293
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,646
When I see her at the studio,
I’ll apologize to her.

294
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,150
Where are you going in the middle
of the night with your acoustic guitar?

295
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,944
Are you also a street musician? How cool.

296
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,404
A street musician?

297
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,657
The lonely hero who wanders
the streets looking for love.

298
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,787
That is so cool!

299
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,416
Bye! Let’s play mahjong again sometime!

300
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,127
He’s so cute, isn’t he?

301
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,422
And sexy too.
Don’t you get horny living with him?

302
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,381
Of course not!

303
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,133
But you’ve had enough with women,
haven’t you?

304
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,386
Never! I've got my whole life ahead of me.

305
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,409
To Nana. Sorry for being so selfish.

306
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:44,498
You probably will never forgive me,

307
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:50,379
but I will never forget the six months
we lived together.

308
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:56,927
It will be lonely not being able
to see you,

309
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,138
but I don’t know what to do.

310
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:04,143
So I hope that your major debut comes soon

311
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,728
and that you’ll be on TV a lot.

312
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,648
Let me see you as you continue singing.

313
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,193
No matter who I’m in love with,

314
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:17,614
you will always be my only hero, Nana.

315
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,703
There’s nobody as cool as you.

316
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:27,082
Until now… and from here on.

317
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,000
P.S. UNTIL YOU FIND A NEW ROOMMATE,

318
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:28,917
PLEASE LET ME CONTINUE PAYING
FOR MY SHARE OF THE APARTMENT.

319
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:29,835
I WILL LOCK THE DOOR ON MY WAY OUT.

320
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:30,752
I'LL SEE TO IT THAT REN GETS MY KEY.

321
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,507
Why are you so sad?

322
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:42,681
This is not a break-up letter
but a passionate love letter.

323
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:48,770
You will always be my only hero, Nana.

324
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,732
Go and visit Hachiko.

325
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,151
You do wanna see her tears of joy
when she sees you, right?

326
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,531
Why should I have to go see her?
That’s irrational!

327
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,288
That’s what a hero does.

328
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,167
Good evening. Street Musician here.

329
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,084
Huh?

330
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,628
MR. STREET MUSICIAN?

331
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,506
-Are you alone? Can I come in?
-Sure.

332
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:27,392
Um, Shin… Mr. Street Musician.
I’m sorry about the other day.

333
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,770
I, Shinichi Okazaki, will now sing.

334
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:52,167
Hey, Hachi… No matter how much
or how often people hurt each other…

335
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:56,421
loving someone is never a waste.

336
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:05,639
Even now, I still cherish that
love letter you gave me then.
