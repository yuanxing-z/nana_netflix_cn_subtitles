1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:09,801
If I were to die now, I doubt Ren
would die with me anymore.

2
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:16,141
But that’s fine. That’s how it should be.

3
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:21,396
I must be crazy for thinking that’s sad.

WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

5
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,466
Excuse me, I’m from next door, and…

6
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,428
I think she’s hyperventilating.

7
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:21,432
D-- Do you have a plastic or paper bag?

8
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,976
You don’t have one?

9
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,312
A paper bag would be better.

10
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:30,400
If you don’t use it right,
plastic could make it worse.

11
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,317
Really?

12
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,820
Or rather, how should she use it?

13
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,781
Well… um… I’ve never been
in this situation before…

14
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,741
You seem like you know a lot.

15
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,035
Is it safe for someone
not in the medical profession to do it?

16
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,540
Sure. I always do it by myself.

17
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,709
Lay her on her back,

18
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,837
then cover her nose and mouth
with the paper bag

19
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,547
but make a little opening.

20
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,382
Like this…

21
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,220
Have her take deep breaths,

22
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,724
and it’ll stop before long.

23
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,729
It’s a living hell.

24
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,275
Th-- Thank you. I’ll give it a shot.

25
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,861
You don’t have to freak out.

26
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:19,198
She’s got that guy,
who is like a tranquilizer.

27
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,367
Tranquilizer?

28
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,536
I was jealous, so I said something mean.

29
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,039
Sorry.

30
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:35,256
As if being pulled up
from the depths of the ocean,

31
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,092
I was finally able to breathe.

32
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:45,183
Yasu’s chest had
the sweet scent of Black Stone.

33
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,811
I’m not going anywhere.

34
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,654
YOU'RE SURE TO FIND IT

35
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,698
-Ah, Ginpei. Keep up the good work.
-Where’s Nana?

36
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:01,741
602

37
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,327
How is she? Did you notify Dr. Azuma?

38
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,455
Calm down.
She was probably just hyperventilating.

39
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,208
The same symptoms as Myu’s.

40
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,797
That’s a problem.

41
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,598
The security guard apparently
phoned the agency

42
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,101
instead of getting an ambulance.

43
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,310
Ginpei rushed over,

44
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:34,023
and he drove me to see a doctor
he said he knew well.

45
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,319
By the time we arrived at the hospital,
which was past its hours of operation,

46
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,114
I was feeling completely back to normal.

47
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,907
But they insisted that
I get checked just to be sure,

48
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,243
and I got a thorough physical checkup.

49
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,327
AZUMA HOSPITAL

50
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,956
Hyperventilation syndrome.
Also known simply as hyperventilation.

51
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,667
-What’s that?
-It’s just as the words suggest.

52
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,377
It’s caused by excessive breathing.

53
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,504
The carbon dioxide levels
in your blood decrease,

54
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,880
causing the attack.

55
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,466
Carbon dioxide levels in my blood?

56
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,135
Be quiet and listen.

57
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,594
Your attack subsided

58
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,930
when you placed a paper bag
over your mouth

59
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,056
and breathed into it.

60
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,058
This is called
"the paper bag technique," and--

61
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,352
Doctor, I don’t need you to share
your knowledge with me.

62
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,605
What the hell’s wrong with me?
Is it my lungs?

63
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,399
-No.
-Then is it my blood?

64
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,692
No.

65
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,862
Then it must be because I smoke
even though I’m on the pill.

66
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,323
But I heard that when you’re young,
a little is all right.

67
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,449
"A little"?

68
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,242
That’s not good.

69
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,910
You risk getting thrombosis, you know.

70
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,830
I know that, but I can’t quit either.

71
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,248
What am I gonna do?

72
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,460
If you’d use protection instead,
then the problem’s solved.

73
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,170
Huh? Me?

74
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,299
Come on, Doctor! You’re misunderstanding!

75
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,675
Yasu belongs to me!

76
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,011
My apologies. But in any case,

77
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,722
the examination shows
there is nothing wrong with you,

78
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,639
so you can relax.

79
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,934
Huh?
I was in so much pain I thought I’d die!

80
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,853
Did you examine me properly?
You rogue doctor!

81
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:54,896
Nana…

82
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,606
Ms. Osaki, calm down.

83
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,692
Hyperventilation can occur
after strenuous exercise,

84
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:03,237
but it can also easily happen
if you’re overly nervous or excited.

85
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,449
But she’s always like this, Doctor.

86
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,952
How can it be cured?

87
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,623
Well, there’s no guarantee
it’ll even happen again.

88
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,458
The best thing to do is
to not worry about it.

89
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:19,712
Of course I’ll be worried!
I’m a singer, Doctor!

90
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,256
Performing live is a tough workout,

91
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,175
and I do get really excited
when performing.

92
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,969
I can’t risk having
another attack onstage!

93
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,763
Please do something!

94
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:33,768
Hmm… But this is stress-related,
which isn’t my area of expertise.

95
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,480
If you’re worried,
I suggest you see a psychiatrist.

96
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,232
If you’d like, I’ll write you a referral.

97
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,943
-A psychiatrist?
-Thank you very much, Doctor!

98
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,986
I always appreciate your help greatly!

99
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,288
Nana!

100
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,875
Oh, you were here?

101
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,836
Oh, you look perfectly fine.

102
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,795
Nana!

103
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,673
Are you feeling all right?
What did the doctor say?

104
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,967
He says I’m nuts, like I thought.

105
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,844
BAM

106
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,513
That hurt!

107
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,599
Wow, that stone head full
of prejudices won’t even crack!

108
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,351
Don’t crack it!

109
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,978
In this modern age,

110
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,939
everyone has to deal
with varying degrees of stress.

111
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,357
It’s truly a difficult world to live in.

112
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,569
You just happen to be
a little more sensitive than others.

113
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,362
There’s nothing wrong with that.

114
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:35,204
But I hate myself for being so weak.

115
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,668
I can’t stand being who I am anymore…

116
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:44,005
So why do these guys
continue being with me?

117
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,508
They've got guts.

118
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,011
FROM NOBU
MESSAGE FROM NANA

119
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,013
I’M REALLY BUSY SO I CAN’T CALL YOU,
BUT I’M DOING REALLY WELL, DARLING!

120
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,181
LET’S BOTH DO OUR BEST.

121
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,810
Why is there so much work to do
immediately after returning?

122
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,312
It can’t be helped.

123
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,814
Going to England wasn’t part
of the original schedule.

124
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,734
-So stop whining!
-Sorry about that.

125
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,819
It’s not your fault, Ren.

126
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,029
I don’t think it was necessary

127
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,656
to go all the way to England
in the first place.

128
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,161
What are you doing?
Don’t touch it with your filthy hands!

129
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,915
Filthy? I’m out of lighter fluid.
That’s a lighter, right?

130
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:24,253
Huh? So that’s a lighter? Wow, it’s huge!

131
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,963
You know, you said the same thing

132
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,467
when you saw the one
Shin was using at the after-party.

133
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,801
Have you forgotten already?

134
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,720
Huh? You mean Shin from BLAST?

135
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,931
He said it was a limited edition.
It’s a rare item.

136
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,516
Is that right?

137
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,018
That one you have isn’t Shin’s, is it?

138
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,269
It isn’t!

139
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,146
Why are you carrying a lighter
in the first place

140
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,814
when you don’t even smoke?

141
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,399
It’s from a fan, and I like it!

142
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,652
Must be nice to get cool stuff like that.

143
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,111
All I get are stuffed animals.

144
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,488
My room’s full of stuffed animals.

145
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,739
You’re actually displaying them?

146
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,741
Ren, hand me your lighter.

147
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,701
FROM SHIN
WELCOME BACK

148
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,371
I’VE BEEN THROWN
INTO THIS JAIL THEY CALL A DORM.

149
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,830
I’M THINKING OF A WAY

150
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,083
THAT I CAN MEET YOU
WITHOUT ANYONE NOTICING

151
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,669
BUT HAVEN’T COME UP WITH ANY IDEAS.

152
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,212
I’D LOVE TO SEE YOU SOON.

153
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,843
Saying I was busy was just an excuse.

154
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,555
I’m sure Ren realized that.

155
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:19,058
But if I heard Ren’s voice,

156
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:24,230
I thought I’d have trouble
breathing again. I was scared.

157
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,692
So now, I’m announcing today’s schedule!

158
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,944
There’s a photoshoot for promo material
at the Harajuku studio.

159
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,530
-Promo material?
-Promotional material.

160
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,115
In the afternoon,

161
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,033
there will be three interviews
for music magazines.

162
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,452
We’re introducing ourselves,
so we’ll be visiting them.

163
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,745
Please make sure
you’re very polite to the people

164
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,955
during these work-related visits.

165
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,498
We want to leave a good impression.

166
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,294
Remember, your rebellious image
is only an act.

167
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,921
Also, if they ask you any questions
about your private lives,

168
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,256
do not answer.

169
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,882
Then, at 7:00 p.m.,
we will meet with event organizers

170
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,468
to discuss the guerrilla live performance.
That will be at the Gaia main office.

171
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,721
A rehearsal at the Kagurazaka
studios at 9:00 p.m.

172
00:09:56,804 --> 00:10:00,433
Finishing time depends on Matsuo’s mood.

173
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:04,520
Well, there you have it.
It’s not as packed as I thought.

174
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,607
That’s plenty packed!
Nana’s still recovering, you know!

175
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,568
-Not a problem at all.
-Well then, we’re leaving now!

176
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,447
-We’ll have breakfast in the car.
-All right! I’m starving!

177
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:19,076
The busier I was, the better I felt.

178
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,245
This is Masaru, the stylist.

179
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,288
Nice to meet you.

180
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,582
-Nice to meet you, too.
-If the work was fulfilling,

181
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:29,128
I felt refreshed, so I didn’t think
I had to go to the hospital.

182
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,672
I don’t intend to change much.

183
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,007
Your styles are already
pretty well established.

184
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,259
I agree! Let’s bring bondage
back into style!

185
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,844
SIGH

186
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,598
There were so many people involved
with BLAST’s debut project

187
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,725
that I couldn’t remember everyone’s names.

188
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,393
I can’t ask about your private lives?

189
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,895
At least tell me what your hobbies are.

190
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,563
-Mahjong.
-That was fast!

191
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,899
Interacting with people
was never my forte,

192
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,068
but I had no problem with it.

193
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,445
Teacher, I’m so hungry
I can’t reach the high notes!

194
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,781
Don’t blame it on your stomach.
One more time!

195
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,866
Yo, Old Fox! How are ya doing?

196
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,993
What dirty tricks do you have
up your sleeve this time?

197
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,162
Nana!

198
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,373
Looking good. Okay, don’t move.

199
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,212
Think we should tell Misato
about the live performance?

200
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,630
But it’s on a weekday.

201
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,882
Midterms are coming up, right?

202
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,258
If we tell her,
it could be a disaster for her.

203
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,719
I wonder if she’ll be able to graduate.

204
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,888
Hey guys! You can’t tell anyone about it!

205
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:25,976
I felt that if I saw Hachi now,
I could laugh and talk with her.

206
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,898
I felt I could even listen to her
talk about Takumi and the baby.

207
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:35,736
But there just wasn’t any time.

208
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,912
I’m sleepy.

209
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:48,457
But if I don’t do the laundry today,
I’ll run out of clothes to wear.

210
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,211
I’ve gotta hurry and move my stuff
from the old apartment

211
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,712
and cancel the lease.

212
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,006
It’s a waste of money.

213
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,716
Won’t anyone do it for me?
The laundry too?

214
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:02,179
But everything won’t fit here.

215
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,932
Should I just send it
to my parents’ place for now?

216
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,226
But I’ll bet Dad’s still angry with me.

217
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,145
But when BLAST’s debut
is officially confirmed,

218
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,063
I’ll bet they’ll be so thrilled.

219
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,166
G-- Good evening.

220
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,759
LAUNDRY

221
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,517
-Um… Can I ask you something?
-Huh?

222
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,480
Ah, well, about hyperventilation.

223
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,733
You probably wouldn’t wanna talk
about it, huh? I’m sorry.

224
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,486
It’s all right. What is it?

225
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,407
One of our staff members told me

226
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,910
that if Nana has another attack,

227
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,580
we should stay calm and act
as if it’s no big deal,

228
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,664
that if the people around her
start to panic,

229
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,999
it would only make her more anxious.

230
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:17,796
I do think he has a point,
and I hear that’s what the doctor’s said,

231
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,715
so that may be the right thing to do.

232
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,468
But wouldn’t you feel lonely
if you were in great pain

233
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,969
and those around you acted
like it’s no big deal?

234
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:29,225
Like, I wonder if I could remain calm.

235
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,392
I doubt I could.

236
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,144
GIGGLE

237
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,604
Huh?

238
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,856
Whether you’re surrounded
by people who are calm or upset,

239
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,610
you wouldn’t be lonely
if you could feel their compassion.

240
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,324
I don’t know about other people,
but that’s how I’d feel.

241
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:53,290
I feel like I just asked
something totally obvious.

242
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,129
-Hey, is that a script for a movie?
-Yeah.

243
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,132
-You’re an actress?
-More or less.

244
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,843
I’m sorry. I didn’t know.

245
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,347
It’s okay. I’m not at all well-known.

246
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,182
This is a small part
for a straight-to-video.

247
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,725
What’s the title?

248
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,686
I’ll be sure to watch it
when it goes on sale!

249
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,688
-Tanki na Onna.
-A mahjong movie?

250
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,065
I love mahjong!
Though I’m really bad at it!

251
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,409
-Um, can I ask you one more thing?
-What?

252
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,327
What’s your name?

253
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:38,127
I wonder how many people
in this city know my name right now.

254
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,382
Hey, what’s that? Is someone coming?

255
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,968
Who knows?
It’s probably some unknown singer.

256
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,970
It would be nice if they could
get Trapnest to perform.

257
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,388
I can never get a ticket.

258
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,931
That’ll never happen.

259
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,601
Anyway, Yuji and the guys are
at the karaoke room and told us to join.

260
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,643
Wanna go?

261
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,229
-Sure. Will they be paying?
-Mr. Kawano? We’re all set here.

262
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,480
LETTERS

263
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,984
Okay, go! Play as hard as you want!

264
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,532
Hi, Yuji? Yeah. We’re on our way now.

265
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,162
-Nana!
-Huh?

266
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,258
-Hey, that’s BLAST! BLAST!
-No way.

267
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,635
-No way! Nana?
-What? Who?

268
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,803
-She’s the worst! Get lost!
-Don't you know them?

269
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,015
I can’t tell which ones are
the hired applauders.

270
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,269
Looks like we’re more famous
than I thought.

271
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,231
I guess Ren’s pretty popular
with the people.

272
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,652
That means we don’t have
to spend time on introductions.

273
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:48,197
I appreciate it, paparazzi.

274
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:53,452
October 10, 2001. 7:00 p.m. in Shinjuku.

275
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,747
You guys all better be thankful

276
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:03,295
for the fate of just happening
to be here right now by coincidence.

277
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,488
FROM YASU
MESSAGE FROM NANA

278
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,532
I’LL BE WAITING AT 7:00
IN FRONT OF ALTA IN SHINJUKU. NANA

279
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,125
Hey, Hachi.

280
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,960
It’s a little far,

281
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:48,257
but that’s the safest VIP seat.

282
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:55,264
I wonder if the baby in your belly
can hear me singing, too.

283
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,149
&lrm;SHIBUYA 109

284
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,280
Good morning, everyone!

285
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,240
It’s Friday, October 26th.

286
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,034
Time for Music J.

287
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,078
The first video clip today is
of the new Trapnest single,

288
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,581
"Shadow of Love."

289
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,086
-I wanna wear the same dress as Reira!
-Huh?

290
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,338
You know, the wedding dress
she wears in the promo video!

291
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,841
It’s so beautiful!
I totally wanna wear it!

292
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,134
Can they make another of the same?

293
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:36,346
We already ordered a dress.
You can’t change it now.

294
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,724
-You’ll make the dressmaker cry.
-But I wanna wear it.

295
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,225
Then I’ll change twice
during the reception.

296
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,560
That’s too many times.

297
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,855
Besides, it’s not the dress that’s pretty.
It’s Reira.

298
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,192
It wouldn’t look good on you. Give it up.

299
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,611
I knew it! You’re involved with Reira!

300
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,905
No, I’m not!
And what do you mean "I knew it"?

301
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,782
Oh, Myu! Good morning!

302
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,868
Calcium? Can I have some?

303
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,580
Hey, Nobu. Will you stop calling me Myu?

304
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,917
-My name’s not Myu. It’s Miu.
-But it’s too hard to pronounce.

305
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,669
Why not? It’s a cute nickname.

306
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,840
Everyone says so,
and no one pronounces my name properly.

307
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,926
Though I really like my name.

308
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,929
No one does?

309
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,890
Then I will be
the only one to call you Miu.

310
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,895
Are you off today?

311
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:28,273
Nope, we’ll be on a music show tonight,
so we’ve got a rehearsal in the afternoon.

312
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,983
You’re really busy, huh?

313
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,944
It’s already been one month
since we moved into the dorm,

314
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:36,031
and Nobu is getting cozy
with the girl next door.

315
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,950
There was no point in us changing rooms!

316
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,410
I would’ve preferred to have
him fool around with Yuri.

317
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:45,749
Why do people easily drift
from one relationship to the next?

318
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,878
Until recently, all he’d say was,
"Hachi, Hachi, Hachi, Hachi."

319
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,173
They’re all such fools, Hachi included.

320
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,886
But it would be too cruel
to force Nobu into a relationship

321
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,888
that has no future.

322
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,808
I have no right to do that.

323
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,435
Hey, this isn’t good.

324
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,689
I’m having… trouble breathing…

325
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,783
Good morning. Are you going somewhere?

326
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,243
Like, to have your hair cut?

327
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:25,372
No, I have a meeting with Mr. Kawano,
so I’ll be leaving ahead of you.

328
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,041
You’re looking pale. Are you feeling okay?

329
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,126
I’m perfectly fine.

330
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:41,138
I can’t keep Yasu
in an unrequited love limbo.

331
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,431
On top of that,

332
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,142
why did I unwittingly move in
next door to him?

333
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,894
That’s pretty cruel.

334
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:51,607
One reason I didn’t wanna get back
with Ren is because

335
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,611
I was feeling
Yasu’s extraordinary love for me.

336
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,739
But in the end, I got swept away.

337
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,116
I’m just one of the fools.

338
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,202
I’ll breathe into this just to be safe.

339
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,329
After all, I have
important work to do today.

340
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:13,170
I’ve managed to keep on living
even when Ren wasn’t around,

341
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:18,175
but without Yasu, I’d probably fall apart.

342
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,178
I’ve gotta end it.

343
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:25,766
The next time I see Ren,
I won’t get swept away.

344
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:28,727
It’s been a while

345
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,687
since we performed live
for a music show on TV!

346
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,397
I’m sure
the fans are looking forward to it.

347
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,524
I bet the ratings are gonna be great!

348
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,860
I’m sure of it.

349
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,779
They’re throwing us in the pit together.

350
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,864
But even if they pick a fight,
I’m not gonna fight back.

351
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,199
-What are you talking about?
-Here, say "Aaah…"

352
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,661
-Do not resort to violence, Takumi.
-BLAST will be performing, too!

353
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,040
Hey, Hachi.

354
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,254
I always thought life was
about standing your ground,

355
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,589
no matter how strong the current is.

356
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,552
But going with the flow isn’t
such a foolish thing after all,

357
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,683
as long as you’re moving forward.
