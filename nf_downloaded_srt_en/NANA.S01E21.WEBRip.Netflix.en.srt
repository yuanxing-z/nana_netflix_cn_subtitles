1
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:05,296
As a child, I thought

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,134
your mother is just your mother,

3
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,344
a teacher is just a teacher,

4
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:16,725
and a police officer is just
a police officer and nothing more.

5
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:23,857
And celebrities were just celebrities.
They were different from me.

6
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,402
And I still felt that way, even now,
at 20 years old.

7
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:44,711
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

8
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,338
But this is such coincidence.
I’m surprised.

9
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:11,965
Me too.

10
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:16,219
Well, surprised doesn’t even
begin to explain how I feel.

11
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,973
So, where should we go?
Do you mind if we get home late?

12
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,142
Tomorrow’s Saturday.
You don’t have work tomorrow, do you?

13
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,643
I don't.

14
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,104
What I wanna know is… Is this reality?

15
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,481
Don’t be so nervous.

16
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,442
I’m sorry. It’s just…

17
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,070
It’s fine. There’s no need to apologize.

18
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,073
But… Oh boy, what am I gonna do?

19
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,534
Now you’re making me nervous.

20
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,411
Huh? Why?

21
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,581
Because, well, I never imagined
in my wildest dreams

22
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,750
that I’d meet you in this manner.
I wasn’t prepared for this.

23
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,836
That’s my line.

24
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,047
But I was thinking how nice
it would be to see you again.

25
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,550
No way. That’s impossible.

26
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:59,929
No, really. Otherwise,
I wouldn’t have called you.

27
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,932
The truth is, I’m terrible
at keeping in touch with people.

28
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,144
Yeah, this has to be a dream.

29
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:09,147
Because in reality,
these things just don’t happen.

30
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,775
Even if they do, at least there’s
no way it would happen to me.

31
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:31,252
Green light already?
What a restless traffic light.

32
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,047
And so am I.

33
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,052
He seems to be quite the player.

34
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:46,351
That dream-like kiss
abruptly woke me up from my dream.

35
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,270
This is not a fairytale.

36
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,731
There’s no way Takumi could be a prince.

37
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,817
He’ll sleep with me once and dump me.

38
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,778
Wait here.

39
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,494
Should I go home right this moment?

40
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,872
I didn’t plan for this to happen.

41
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,416
Hey, isn’t he that guy from Trapnest?

42
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,169
Wow! Cool! He’s so tall!

43
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,006
Then why did I get into his car?

44
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,844
I’m not that foolish to believe he would
even think of making me his girlfriend.

45
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:28,101
And I’m not that naive to think
this’ll end after a drive and dinner.

46
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,772
There must be a part of me
that was hoping for this.

47
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,276
There’s no need to hesitate.

48
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,236
I’ll never be
in a situation like this ever again.

49
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:42,740
I don’t have a boyfriend now,
so there’s no reason to feel guilty.

50
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,744
Think of this as creating
a once in a lifetime special memory.

51
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,330
Sorry to keep you waiting.

52
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,337
-He's from Trapnest…
-Ren?

53
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,463
The long haired guy.

54
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:03,094
Th-- They saw us. And what’s worse,
while he had his arm around me.

55
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,723
We’ll be in the tabloids. We’ll be on TV.

56
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,267
I’m hungry…

57
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,228
-Um… Mr. Takumi…
-Mr.?

58
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,023
You’ve always just called me Takumi.

59
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,775
Well that’s true, but…
that’s not the point.

60
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,193
It may not be something
for me to point out,

61
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,737
but aren’t you concerned

62
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,655
of the risks of being seen
entering a hotel with a girl?

63
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,658
At the least, perhaps you should
wear a complete disguise.

64
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,827
A complete disguise?

65
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,456
But if I wore a costume,
I’d stand out even more.

66
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,167
You’d look good in one!

67
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,668
This is no time to be joking!

68
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,795
Not to worry.

69
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,298
The entertainment reporters are
too busy to be following my every step.

70
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,259
Our band keeps a lid
on our public appearances,

71
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,887
so people don’t recognize us enough
that we need to be overly cautious.

72
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,515
What are you saying?
Trapnest is really famous.

73
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,685
I guess Reira is. She may need a costume.

74
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,354
I’d say all four of you share
about the same level of fame.

75
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,690
You think that because you’re a fan.

76
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,651
The general public may
also recognize Ren, but that’s it.

77
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,654
Naoki and I are known
as the blonde guy and the long-haired guy.

78
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,989
That’s not true!

79
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,949
You’re number one in my book, Takumi!

80
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,166
I’ll bet he thinks of me
as a foolish, easy woman.

81
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,087
But that’s basically
the type of woman I am.

82
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:20,755
With all I’ve been through,

83
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,549
I thought I had become
more cautious towards men.

84
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,011
But nothing’s changed since that summer
back when I was seventeen.

85
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,641
If only I could remain high
on this moment of happiness,

86
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,435
I wouldn’t even care about tomorrow.

87
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,437
What’s this?

88
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,855
Awesome!

89
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,732
It’s huge! There are two rooms!

90
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,609
So pretty! It’s like a castle.

91
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,693
Would this happen to be…

92
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,946
A suite room?

93
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,490
Do you like it?

94
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:52,453
Right now, I’m so happy I could just die.

95
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,455
If I could die here,
I’d die a happy woman.

96
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,125
If you must die, do it in bed.

97
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,129
But before that,
let’s get something to eat.

98
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,548
Choose anything you like.

99
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,759
Huh? Are you suggesting
that we eat in the room?

100
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,178
Oh, if you prefer not to, we can dine out.

101
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,682
No, I’ve dreamed
of ordering room service in a hotel!

102
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,934
Their specialty is duck.

103
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,270
Duck? I’ve never had duck.

104
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:20,565
Really? Never? It’s great.
Then how about foie gras?

105
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,733
I’ve totally never had foie gras.

106
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,361
-Then should we get some caviar too?
-Yay!

107
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,240
Why not take a shower
and relax until the food arrives?

108
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,825
There’s a bathrobe, so use that.

109
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,953
Yes. A bathrobe?

110
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,123
He knows this place
as if it was his own castle.

111
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,627
These are brand name cosmetics.
I wonder if I can take them home.

112
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:48,968
I’m sure tons of foolish girls like me
approach Takumi,

113
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,762
and I’m no more than one of the many.

114
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:55,391
But if I’m here, well aware of that,
there should be nothing wrong

115
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,603
with me spending one night
to purposely enjoy a dream, right?

116
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:00,771
Delicious!

117
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,231
Isn’t it?

118
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,360
But to me, the food you prepared
was better than this, Nana.

119
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,820
That’s impossible.

120
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,739
No, I’m serious.

121
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,950
While on tour, we always eat out,
and I get sick and tired of it.

122
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,120
By the way, you’re back on your tour
starting tomorrow, right?

123
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,872
Are you okay for time?

124
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,707
Not a problem.

125
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,085
We leave early in the morning,
so I'm gonna leave at midnight,

126
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,671
but you can take it easy
and spend the night here, Nana.

127
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,509
What? He’s gonna leave?

128
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:33,471
Come on, don’t make such a sad face.
It’ll make it hard for me to go.

129
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,182
Oh, no, I’m sorry. That’ll be fine.

130
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,976
I don’t mind.
I’m not thinking of anything as dreamy

131
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,896
as keeping you here with me
until the morning.

132
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,197
Once the tour is over…

133
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,659
I’ll come to see you.

134
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,494
When I do, would you mind
cooking for me again?

135
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,290
I mustn’t take him seriously.

136
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,710
It’s okay. I’m not that stupid.

137
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,464
I guess I am different
from when I was seventeen.

138
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,299
Thank you for the meal.

139
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,719
Then I’ll go take a quick shower.

140
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,680
You can warm up and wait for me.

141
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,932
You are really impatient, Takumi.

142
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:21,727
I’m not thinking of quickly running home
after eating all that I can.

143
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,354
So take your time.

144
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,066
But I can’t help but wonder

145
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,736
how many women Takumi’s slept with,
using this method.

146
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,447
Is he really satisfied
with commoners like me

147
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,615
who have little money and no skills?

148
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,704
I’ve gotta warm up. Gotta warm up.

149
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,748
The phone. Should I turn the ringer off?

150
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,626
090… who is it?

151
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,378
Hello.

152
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,921
Hachiko!

153
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,299
You’re late, so I’m getting worried.

154
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,426
Where are you wandering at this hour?

155
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,721
Nana? Huh? Whose phone
are you calling from?

156
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,055
Mine.

157
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,890
So you bought a cell phone.

158
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,810
Well, Ren bought me one.
He insisted I carry one.

159
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,186
Is that so? That’s great.

160
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,190
But I don’t understand how to use it.
Like how to email.

161
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,525
Doesn’t it have a manual?

162
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,527
It’s thick, so I don’t wanna read it.

163
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,572
I thought I’d have you teach me
when you got home,

164
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,990
so I’ve been waiting.

165
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,950
But unless yours is
the same model as mine,

166
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,368
the functions are gonna be different.

167
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,620
Is that so?

168
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,539
Then hurry home, read the manual
and teach me how to use it.

169
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,751
What about Ren? Have Ren teach you.

170
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,586
The person who bought that for you
should be responsible.

171
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,630
Ren left a short while ago.

172
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,966
Of course. He has to leave
early tomorrow morning.

173
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:35,885
I’m surprised you know that.

174
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,971
B-- Because Ren said so yesterday!

175
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:39,889
Yeah?

176
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,515
Mm-hmm! He totally did!

177
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,810
So, where are you now?
When are you coming home?

178
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,938
Well… um, sorry… maybe not today.

179
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,441
I’m at a friend’s place,
and I might stay over.

180
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,527
Really? So there are friends
who are willing to have you stay over,

181
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,737
knowing how troublesome you are.

182
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,198
A guy?

183
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,866
N-- No! I-- I’m at Jun-chan’s!

184
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,745
I’m joking. Don’t take it so seriously.

185
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,081
All right. I’ll study
my cell phone on my own.

186
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,124
Say "Hi" to Junko for me.

187
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,628
I can’t tell Nana.

188
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,255
I don’t want her to know.

189
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,259
If she finds out that I’m knowingly
being such an easy woman,

190
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,512
she’ll never look at me the same.

191
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,307
But you know, Nana…

192
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:27,436
The truth is, I wanna love someone
as diligently as you do.

193
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:32,274
Like you and Ren, I wanna have
that connection with someone.

194
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:37,113
Hey, Nana. The truth is,
I’m not at all okay.

195
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:42,076
I’d hate to be dumped by Takumi
after a one-night stand.

196
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,745
What should I do? I’m scared, Nana.

197
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,289
But I can’t run away at this stage.

198
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,668
I can’t bring myself to tell him
I want him to love me.

199
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,256
This isn’t good.

200
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,883
I could end up
feeling hurt all over again.

201
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,719
IF ANYONE ASKS, I’M STAYING
AT YOUR PLACE TONIGHT. NANA

202
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:04,056
Say, what do you think
about this alibi creation?

203
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,810
-Nana’s roommate is a woman, right?
-Mm-hmm.

204
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,689
But that woman is more handsome
and manly than your average man.

205
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,649
Nana seems to have a serious crush on her.

206
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,484
Maybe those two are a couple.

207
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,195
But never mind that.

208
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,363
Really?

209
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,448
There’s something fishy about this.

210
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,657
About what?

211
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,201
Jun-chan. Are you feeling drunk?

212
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,872
It’s the smell of a new man.

213
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,666
I just hope she hasn’t been
caught by some guy so terrible

214
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:31,792
she can’t even tell her roommate.

215
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,797
Takumi’s hair was so long,
it showered my body.

216
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,134
As I let it caress me,

217
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,345
I laid there wishing
he would always keep it long…

218
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:49,018
even though I may never touch it again.

219
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,126
He said it’ll be hard for him to go,

220
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,045
but once he’s done, he’s quick to leave.

221
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,758
Even his departure is hurried.
Such a busy prince.

222
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,971
I should go home too. I’m done
with playing a make-believe princess.

223
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,142
What? I can’t.

224
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,812
I have no strength.
It’s as if I have no bones.

225
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:43,405
I have to pull myself together.
I must quickly return to reality.

226
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,951
In the morning, I’ve gotta look
for whatever job is available.

227
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,496
And this time, I’m gonna
take my work seriously.

228
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,501
Damn! The last train left long ago.

229
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,879
And I don’t have enough money
to take a taxi home.

230
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,632
I might as well spend the night here.

231
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,051
It’s likely a once
in a lifetime opportunity

232
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,178
to stay in place like this anyway.

233
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,613
Trapnest’s tour ends on the eighth of July

234
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,115
with a performance in Tokyo.

235
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,869
I don’t have a ticket,

236
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,496
so I’ll prepare something
and wait at home.

237
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:38,168
I’ll be waiting with a little bit of hope.
Just a little bit of hope.

238
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,797
You met with Yasu? What the heck?

239
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,257
Why didn’t you invite me?

240
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,385
Be quiet, blondie.

241
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,597
Is Yasu doing okay?

242
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,683
I guess so. He hasn’t really changed.

243
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,561
-Is he still a skinhead?
-Yeah.

244
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,354
-With his nose piercing?
-Yeah!

245
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:01,525
-So? What’s Yasu doing now?
-I mean it. Shut up, Naoki.

246
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,903
I haven’t had much sleep. Let me sleep.

247
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:04,862
Someone, switch seats with him.

248
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,531
Then I’ll switch with Naoki.

249
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,496
Hey, Take, which side is Mount Fuji on?
Which side can we see it from?

250
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,873
Are you listening?

251
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,628
-Say, Takumi…
-Yasu? He’s a lawyer now apparently.

252
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,924
That’s not what I’m asking.

253
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,800
But you wanted to know.

254
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:30,262
So he really did become one,
even with that look.

255
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,180
Even with that look?

256
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,684
So his dream came true. I’m glad.

257
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,813
He had already passed
the qualification exam

258
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,690
during his fourth year in university.

259
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,400
That’s really something, don’t you think?

260
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,235
Is it that unusual?

261
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,488
Would you stay outta this, blondie?

262
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,867
But now he’s moved to Tokyo
because of his band.

263
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,702
So maybe his dream is to become
a pro musician.

264
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,080
Huh? Moved to Tokyo? Because of his band?

265
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,832
The band he and Ren had
before Ren joined us.

266
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,169
They found a new bassist

267
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,796
and have been giving it
some serious effort.

268
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,548
I can't believe it!

269
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,717
After snobbishly telling me repeatedly

270
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,221
that bands are nothing more than
a hobby? I don’t get him!

271
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,974
Yeah. Leaves a bad taste, doesn’t it?
Want me to rough him up?

272
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,478
What made him decide to do this now?

273
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,108
Yasu!

274
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,651
MUSIC STUDIO

275
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,571
Why are you smoking?

276
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,116
Never mind. Continue smoking.

277
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:37,287
I know very well that you
only stop smoking in front of me.

278
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,416
You’re only considerate like that
on the surface.

279
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,292
But then you secretly do stuff
in the shadows.

280
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,420
What else are you hiding?

281
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,255
Nothing really.

282
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:50,384
You have too many secrets!
I’m really pissed off, you know!

283
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,761
Why didn’t you say anything
about you and Reira?

284
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,264
Oh, that. I’m sorry.

285
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,892
"Were you that impressed
by Reira’s voice?"

286
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,729
-It’s not funny!
-I said I’m sorry.

287
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,776
She was really great, that Reira.

288
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:12,281
I felt so defeated. I’m no match for her.

289
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,741
Was she like that since the old days?

290
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,119
Is that what you call gifted?

291
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,874
I guess.

292
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,877
But she has defined abs.

293
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,716
Hmm… You sure are well informed.

294
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,262
Where’s Hachi? Isn’t she coming today?

295
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,432
-Nobu, that’s all you’ve been saying.
-Huh?

296
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,392
Hey, Nobu. Are you in love with Hachiko?

297
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,685
No, I, ah…

298
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,229
It’s just that, it’s kinda lonely
without our regular audience.

299
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,190
But Hachi’s only one person.

300
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,568
I want to perform live!

301
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,529
-I need to release this tension!
-Then let’s do it.

302
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,364
We got an offer to perform.

303
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,908
Tell us more.

304
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,493
Our performance at the Live House…

305
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,496
The crowd liked us, so they asked
if we’d be interested in doing another.

306
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,413
Let’s do it.

307
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,873
-All right!
-All right!

308
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,250
That day, I checked
the classifieds for job offers

309
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,877
and went to three job interviews

310
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,464
for a dentist’s receptionist,
a supermarket cashier,

311
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,925
and a phone operator for a pizza place.

312
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,676
I got turned down by them all.

313
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,678
What could they have found about me
that they didn’t like?

314
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,014
I wanna know why you got fired
from your job in the first place.

315
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,142
Well, because I started making
a habit of skipping work…

316
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,353
But at the interviews,
I told them in clear terms

317
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,271
that I will take work seriously this time.

318
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,649
Then you told them that you got fired
because you skipped work?

319
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,566
You’re such a fool!

320
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,071
You’ve gotta realize, if you take
just any job that you can get,

321
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,365
you’ll end up with the same result.

322
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,700
Why not look for a job
that better suits you?

323
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,452
What would be a job that suits me?

324
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,579
Well, maybe not specifically
one that suits you.

325
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:47,292
Any job will do as long
as it’s a job you enjoy doing.

326
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,628
If the workplace deals
with things you like,

327
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,838
you’d be more motivated, don’t you think?

328
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,799
When you were working for Mr. Mizukoshi,

329
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,844
you were surrounded by nice things,
and you wore those pretty clothes.

330
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,762
You seemed so alive at that job.

331
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,056
Why not look for another job like that?

332
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,852
I see. That makes sense. She’s right.

333
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,479
I wonder how Mr. Mizukoshi is doing.

334
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,273
Never mind Mr. Mizukoshi!

335
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,233
But I sometimes think about him.

336
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,611
I don’t mind telling you now,
but I kind of had a crush on him.

337
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,114
You don’t have to tell me. I could tell.

338
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,909
But, you know, taking Mr. Mizukoshi
and Takumi into consideration,

339
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,119
you have a thing for long hair, don’t you?

340
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,412
No way!

341
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,080
What’s with your overreacting?

342
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,416
Because you’re saying strange things!

343
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:31,128
Strange? I prefer men with short hair…

344
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,630
You have it wrong!
Mr. Asano had short hair!

345
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,340
-Asano?
-And so did Shoji!

346
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,890
Well, I think his hair is pretty long.

347
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,476
Yeah? Well, I guess that wouldn’t be
considered short.

348
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,979
Seeing that you’re comfortable
talking about him,

349
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,022
I guess you’re over him now.

350
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,652
It would be nice if you could find
a boyfriend soon, one with long hair.

351
00:19:56,403 --> 00:20:00,782
There was just no way that
I could tell Nana about Takumi.

352
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,954
Being who he is, I couldn’t even
tell Jun-chan about him.

353
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,998
I wasn’t able to discuss him with anyone.

354
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,793
I’ve never experienced such love,
so it was very painful.

355
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,256
Shoji, are you moving?

356
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,594
What? Shoji’s moving in with Sachiko?

357
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,639
They’re such a lovey-dovey couple.

358
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:28,852
That’s nice. I envy them. It's young love.

359
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,772
You’re right.

360
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:34,775
YOU’RE PLAYING IN KYUSHU
STARTING TODAY, RIGHT?

361
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:35,776
TAKE CARE AND BEST OF LUCK
TO THE END OF THE TOUR. - NANA

362
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:39,154
During his tour, I gathered my courage

363
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,949
and sent Takumi a short email message.

364
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,494
But I never got a reply.

365
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,163
REN
CONCERT CONGRATULATIONS

366
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,207
TASTE THE EUPHORIA.
FROM THE GUITAR GENIUS

367
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,708
Hey, Nana…

368
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,628
I always admired you.

369
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,464
I wanted to be like you.

370
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,635
I lived life always thinking that.

371
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:08,892
So please. Please sing again, once more.
