1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:08,800
The strawberry glasses were still
being sold at the 100 yen store.

2
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:14,014
But when I thought about how
importantly Hachi treated them

3
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:17,058
without buying any spares,

4
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:21,104
the cut on my left cheek that
I don’t even remember getting

5
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,814
started hurting like hell.

6
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:50,842
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

7
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,872
That will be 105 yen.

8
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:07,585
Tonight, I’ll return home
and apologize to Hachi.

9
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,631
Thank you for coming.

10
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:15,844
The glass probably broke.

11
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,764
I can’t remember,
but I think that’s what happened.

12
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:25,186
It’s also a mystery how
I ended up at Ren’s place

13
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,148
when I was trying to be careful
not to cause a scandal…

14
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,902
but I’m just glad I didn’t wake up
in Yasu’s room.

15
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:38,575
I can’t rely on Yasu’s kindness anymore…

16
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,662
because Yasu isn’t mine.

17
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:17,906
Reira, I’m sorry, but I’ve gotta
get back to work right away.

18
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,785
Sorry.

19
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,704
I’ll come home as soon as I can.

20
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,623
Can you be here on your own until then?

21
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:43,056
I’m locking the door,
so don’t open the door for anyone.

22
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:04,035
I’m sorry, Yasu,
to call you out of the blue like this.

23
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:08,665
I couldn’t think of anyone else
I could depend on.

24
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:14,587
I ran away from the recording.

25
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:21,427
Takumi said he’s getting married,
and I couldn’t bring myself to sing.

26
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:27,141
But I didn’t know where to go.

27
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:32,522
No matter where I go,
I feel like everyone’s watching me.

28
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,315
I’m scared.

29
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:39,362
If people found out that I ran away
from a recording,

30
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,781
they’d be disappointed in me.

31
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,993
The staff and the fans…

32
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:52,875
They’d abandon me, saying I’m finished.
But I can’t sing now.

33
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,503
What am I to do?

34
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:01,092
I’m worthless unless I sing.

35
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,903
I just heard back from Mr. Takeda!

36
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,865
She didn’t go back to the hotel either!

37
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,702
She left with her stuff, right?

38
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,078
Did you try calling her cell?

39
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,247
Several times, but she won’t answer.

40
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,541
But why did she run away like that?

41
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,960
She was all excited earlier,
saying she’s gonna sell a million copies.

42
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:40,173
Does anyone have any clue
where else she might’ve gone?

43
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,258
I was transferred here recently,

44
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:45,428
so there’s still much I don’t know
about Reira’s private life.

45
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,680
Maybe she went to her secret lover!

46
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,892
Come to think of it,
does she have any close friends?

47
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,477
I haven’t a clue. Don’t ask me.

48
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,230
But Takumi, you and Reira have been
friends since you were kids, right?

49
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,941
So what?

50
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,486
Nothing.

51
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,696
What should we do, Takumi?

52
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,448
Should we proceed with recording anyway?

53
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,827
With all this commotion around us,
we can’t concentrate.

54
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,204
We can’t do it.

55
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,413
I guess so.

56
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,082
I’m sorry.

57
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:21,714
It’s okay, Mari.
Your job is to take care of Reira,

58
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,301
so just worry about Reira
and don't worry about anything else.

59
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,552
Okay.

60
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,473
If you understand that,
then go find her and drag her back!

61
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,649
I’m sorry.

62
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:45,363
Don’t cry, Mari. That guy is scary.
I’m scared of him, too.

63
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,627
Drinking on the job?

64
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,254
It’s water!

65
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,969
If work is that important to you,
don’t go saying something

66
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,013
that would upset our songstress
before the recording.

67
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,892
If it’s to test her professionalism,
you’re being too much of an evil coach.

68
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,853
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

69
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:21,232
Don’t try to act stupid!
You know Reira’s in love with you.

70
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,525
Don’t put it so simply!

71
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:26,028
Years of acting like I didn’t know
just went down the drain!

72
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,741
Acting like you don’t know
won’t solve the problem.

73
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,493
If you get married,

74
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,537
Reira might not be able
to sing anymore, you know.

75
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,832
If me getting married means
she’s gonna stop singing,

76
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,542
then we have big problems.

77
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:44,547
I have no feelings of love for her.
I can’t help it.

78
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,845
Well, I guess so.

79
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,930
But if Reira won’t sing,
Trapnest is finished.

80
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,559
I know that! So what do you want me to do?

81
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,439
If the lord showed a little more love,
the princess might wanna sing.

82
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,443
Are you telling me to do it with Reira?

83
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:09,655
She’s like a little sister to me!
There’s no way I could do that!

84
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,699
But you’re not a blood relative.

85
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,284
That’s not the point!

86
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,205
But you’ve always been the type
to do whatever it takes

87
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,583
to achieve your objectives.

88
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,294
Compared to marrying an ordinary girl
who’s only after your money,

89
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:27,131
you’ll end up with a larger castle
with a marriage of convenience to Reira.

90
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,509
-Castle?
-It suits you.

91
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,262
I never knew you were so ambitious.

92
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,265
I’d never do such a thing.

93
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:41,103
I’m just suggesting a way of living
for someone as greedy and brutal as you.

94
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,396
What’s that supposed to mean?

95
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,814
Don’t try to act like a good person!

96
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,734
You’re the man who abandoned
your woman and friends!

97
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,362
You even sold your soul,
all for your own success!

98
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,613
Although I’m the one who bought it.

99
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,865
My soul?

100
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,618
You were a punk rocker to the core.

101
00:08:55,701 --> 00:09:01,082
You were coolest when you could play
whatever you wanted in a small room.

102
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,461
Although you still are… a pretty cool guy…

103
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,673
like some orthodox hero.

104
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,969
I wanna hear Ren Honjo’s soul shout!

105
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,397
But don’t you think it’s funny?

106
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,733
The bigger the castle gets,
the more confining it feels.

107
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,655
Before I knew it,
I had locked my cute little sister

108
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,241
in the top of a high tower…

109
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,910
even though I can’t love her.

110
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,584
That’s the greatest sin of my life.

111
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:51,424
But she only knows how to sing
and nothing else.

112
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,844
And I can’t turn back now.

113
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:02,560
If only there were a prince
who’d climb up that tower to hold her.

114
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,869
Turn off your phone at least
during recording!

115
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,288
But we’re not recording.

116
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,207
Yeah, but at least have it on silent.

117
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,379
Hello, darling! No, that’s okay.

118
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,634
The Lord is in a foul mood,
so we’re not getting any work done.

119
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,803
He’s right beside me.

120
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:39,639
Who is it?

121
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,600
The former prince. Though he’s bald.

122
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,737
Um, excuse me.
You’re Takumi from Trapnest, right?

123
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,491
I’m a huge fan of yours!
Can I shake your hand?

124
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,244
Thank you so much!

125
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,997
Who’s that, Mommy?
Someone who sings songs?

126
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,249
Someone who plays instruments.

127
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,963
Wasn’t that great?

128
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:30,064
Sorry for causing you trouble
during a busy time.

129
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:34,110
Reira will hate me again for doing this.

130
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:39,573
But for her to say
she’s worthless unless she sings?

131
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:44,412
I didn’t break up with her
so I could hear her say such things.

132
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,331
Do something about it.

133
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,168
If that’s how you feel,
then you do something about it.

134
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,255
Being the hated one is my exclusive right.

135
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,997
Yasu, you traitor!

136
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,173
-That baldie!
-Reira, please calm down!

137
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,676
It’s all right! I won’t take you back!

138
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,678
The recording has been postponed!

139
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:50,811
Takumi asked that you be given time off
until you’re ready to sing again.

140
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,564
He went and talked
to the president himself.

141
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:57,026
We’ll have to rearrange the schedule,
but at the very least,

142
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,819
you'll be able to take off the entire week

143
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,238
that was set aside for recording.

144
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,615
Isn’t that great?

145
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:07,328
Takumi may say some harsh things,
but he certainly thinks about you, Reira.

146
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,041
-You’re wrong, Mari.
-Huh?

147
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,880
Takumi has abandoned me.

148
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,301
He doesn’t need a singer
who runs away from her job!

149
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,806
What are you saying?
I’m sure that’s not true!

150
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,807
I’m sorry, Mari.

151
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,560
I’ll return to the studio right away,
so let everyone know.

152
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,815
But you couldn’t possibly sing
in this condition.

153
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,778
Please! Don’t take away my chance to sing!

154
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,248
Singing is all I’ve got.

155
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,962
This restaurant pisses me off.
Don’t play Trapnest songs.

156
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,048
Play some Enka!
You’re ruining our ramen noodles, old man!

157
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,884
I’m sorry! We’ll eat quickly and leave.

158
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:08,222
It’s only natural that the radio
would play what’s popular.

159
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:11,433
Besides, it’s a song Ren wrote.
You should like it.

160
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,436
This isn’t Ren’s.

161
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,398
But more importantly,
you need to see a doctor.

162
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,607
A doctor?

163
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:22,695
Memory loss isn’t normal at all.
I’ll come with you.

164
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,238
No way!

165
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:27,324
You know, you’ve been rude lately,
telling me I’m strange.

166
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,035
But you were saying that yourself, too.

167
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,831
You could have some kind of brain disease.

168
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:34,957
You should get it checked.

169
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,962
I’m fine. Darn. I shouldn’t have told you.

170
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,631
Annoying, annoying, annoying!

171
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,592
Thanks for the meal.

172
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,137
Now, I’ll listen to your whining
as I promised.

173
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,722
It’s all right.

174
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,224
If I tell you, you might just
rub salt in my wound.

175
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,851
I wanna hear it!

176
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,437
How could things have come
to this in one day?

177
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,479
Come to this?

178
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,861
Don’t you know?
What the hell have you been doing?

179
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:04,987
What about you?

180
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,405
Where have you been hiding
since last night?

181
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,283
At such an important time for Hachi!
That’s so cold of you!

182
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,244
As a friend,

183
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,747
shouldn’t you have gone straight to her
and heard what she had to say?

184
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,959
She would only cry and apologize to me.

185
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,003
She wouldn’t tell me anything.

186
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,423
So you went.

187
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,717
You two are both women.

188
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,219
She might’ve opened up and talked
to you about her true feelings.

189
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:34,058
But when I went back this morning,
Hachiko wouldn’t say a word to me either!

190
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,726
She had Takumi do all the talking.

191
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,812
What did he say?

192
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,530
It’s okay. Tell me.
Nothing will shock me anymore.

193
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,911
He said they’re getting married.

194
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,292
You are shocked! Of course you are!

195
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,418
It makes no sense, right?

196
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:10,344
I’m sorry, Nobu. Are you all right?

197
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,137
Well, ah… yeah.

198
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,141
I sort of knew it was over
from the way Nana was acting yesterday.

199
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,685
"Nana"?

200
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,814
After all, it’s Takumi she loves.

201
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:25,859
I knew that from the beginning.

202
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:30,614
But you called her Hachi
in front of everyone.

203
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:36,870
But I’m part of this,
so why am I out of the loop?

204
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:44,128
Am I that unreliable to her?

205
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,054
It’s okay to cry, Nobu!

206
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,431
Cry on my shoulder!

207
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,724
What the hell?

208
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,727
This is no time to be embarrassed!
It’s just between us.

209
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,020
But people are staring…

210
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,439
So what? You’re too short
to be acting cool anyway!

211
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:07,026
Don’t call me short!
At least I’m taller than you!

212
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:07,943
I know that!

213
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,947
I also know that you’ve got a heart
way bigger than mine!

214
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:16,368
Before I met you, I hated everyone!

215
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,620
I couldn’t trust anybody!

216
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,080
But then when I met you,

217
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,624
I felt for the first time that this world
isn’t all that bad!

218
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,171
Terashima. Thanks for these.

219
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,593
You are not unreliable, Nobu.

220
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,556
Don’t get down on yourself just
because some girl dumped you.

221
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:49,318
Your spikes are digging into my neck.

222
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,324
Nobu’s shoulders are
way scrawnier than Ren’s,

223
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,659
but they weren’t shaking.

224
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:04,458
I was offering him my shoulder
but ended up borrowing his instead.

225
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,262
I owe Nobu so much.

226
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:22,768
I really can’t make up with Hachi.

227
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:29,149
I’ll take the strawberry glass
to Ren’s place.

228
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,485
We can’t use these!

229
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,073
How could you stick with them
for a full month

230
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,283
and not get a shot of them together?

231
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,830
Because they’re
on completely different schedules,

232
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,665
and they never leave together, you see!

233
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,041
Don’t "you see" me!

234
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,211
You probably did something
to make them cautious.

235
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,213
All of you are idiots!

236
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,840
Let’s just give up on that

237
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,550
and write an article
using two different shots.

238
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,093
I’m not compromising.

239
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,053
You want someone else beating us
to the story?

240
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:03,809
Kurata. Fly to their hometown immediately.

241
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,769
Huh?

242
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,814
Trapnest is recording in the studio
every day this week.

243
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,065
Following them won’t do us any good.

244
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,692
In the meantime,

245
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:15,821
gather everything you can on Ren Honjo
and Nana Osaki’s backgrounds.

246
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,322
What a drag.

247
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,034
Gaia seems to be reluctant
about giving BLAST their debut,

248
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,954
but this’ll make
the greatest "Battle of the Bands."

249
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,206
I’ll create a huge festival for you

250
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,543
and bring you onto the same stage
as Trapnest in a heartbeat.

251
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,296
You should thank me, Nana Osaki.

252
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,758
The curtains are about to rise
on your fateful game.

253
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,970
Ms. Komatsu. Registered mail for you!

254
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:41,930
MS. NANA KOMATSU,

255
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,056
THANK YOU FOR CONSULTING WITH OUR FIRM.

256
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,016
WE’VE GATHERED SOME LISTINGS OF PROPERTIES

257
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,225
THAT FIT THE CONDITIONS
YOU NOTED THE OTHER DAY.

258
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,602
PLEASE REVIEW THE MATERIAL.
IF YOU WOULD LIKE…

259
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,107
THREE BEDROOM APARTMENT
IN MINAMI AOYAMA

260
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,609
MONTHLY RENT 1,000,000 YEN

261
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:07,581
You know, Hachi…
I was hostile toward Trapnest

262
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:11,501
because I was envious of Reira
for stealing Ren’s heart,

263
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:15,172
not as a woman but as a singer.

264
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,425
I only wanted Ren to notice me more.

265
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,345
I never wanted to make them my enemy.

266
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,431
It’s so moving, isn’t it?

267
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:27,100
This’ll sell way more than a million.

268
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,312
How much harder are you gonna push her
until you’re satisfied?

269
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,231
I have no idea what you’re talking about.

270
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,407
At least let me accompany her
with my guitar,

271
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,077
since I can’t hug her.

272
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:53,794
But ever since that day
when you were taken away from me,

273
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,589
I couldn’t help but feel
the need to defeat them.

274
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:05,264
I wanted you back… no matter what.
