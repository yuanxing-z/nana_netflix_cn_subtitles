1
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,888
I figured if they could not
become pro after this,

2
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:16,599
there’s something seriously wrong
with this world.

3
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:44,919
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

4
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:57,158
That day was BLAST’s third time
on the stage in the big city.

5
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,494
It was at the same venue as usual.

6
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,913
They performed the opening act
for 40 minutes.

7
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,130
BLAST is really popular!

8
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,216
The line was all the way
to the convenience store.

9
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,511
Misato told me excitedly
as she returned from buying some juice.

10
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,848
She had passed the line of people waiting
since before the concert hall opened,

11
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,725
hoping to get seats close to the front.

12
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,104
That was the right decision to come early.

13
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:29,732
You might wanna tell
Junko and Kyosuke to hurry.

14
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,443
But Jun-chan was a bit pissed off
at the concert the other day,

15
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,154
being pushed around by the crowd.

16
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,239
She said she would watch
from the back today.

17
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,324
Don’t push! I’m dying here!

18
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,242
Ouch!

19
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,579
Huh? Why? That life-risking feeling
is what makes it so special!

20
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,918
It never gets that heated
at the concerts back home.

21
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,422
I was so excited that I almost passed out.

22
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,716
Almost passed out?

23
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,219
It was only their third concert,

24
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,639
but they opened the hall earlier than
scheduled because of the long line,

25
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,517
and in a blink of an eye,
the place was packed.

26
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,145
Awesome! Awesome! Super awesome!

27
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,731
Jun-chan and Kyosuke might not
be able to get in.

28
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,108
What? Tickets are sold out?

29
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,027
Wow. Incredible.

30
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,488
We’re all standing anyway.
Can’t you squeeze in just two more?

31
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,908
But we’re already way past capacity.

32
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,619
I beg you.
Our friends are performing at seven.

33
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,121
Your friends? Are you on the guest list?

34
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,748
-I dunno.
-Your names?

35
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,791
Saotome and Takakura.

36
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,669
That’s fine. Go ahead.

37
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,838
If you don’t mind standing
in the hallway way up in the back.

38
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,966
-Hey, do you have tickets?
-No.

39
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,052
Then give up. The show is sold out.

40
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,511
-What?
-What?

41
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:45,183
No way! We came all the way out
to Tokyo just to come to this concert!

42
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,435
See? I told you we should’ve left earlier.

43
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,188
It’s your fault for insisting
on attending those classes!

44
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,315
But the teacher said he wouldn’t
let me graduate high school

45
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,608
unless I attended those classes!

46
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,944
Well, that’s your fault
for not studying hard enough!

47
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,947
I beg of you, please let us in!

48
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,241
Impossible! Any more people
and we’d be facing safety issues!

49
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,618
Some concert isn’t worth
losing your life over!

50
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,162
-It sure is!
-Like I said, it’s impossible.

51
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,331
Nana! Nana!

52
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,958
Crying isn’t gonna help.

53
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:15,129
Listen… Let these girls go in
instead of us.

54
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:20,802
The enthusiasm of the crowd increased
with each concert.

55
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,637
I started feeling dizzy from it.

56
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,598
Oh, I’m sorry.

57
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,808
It’s okay.

58
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,226
Excuse me.

59
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:31,145
But thank goodness we got in, Akiko.

60
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,439
Fortunately, our expensive
plane tickets didn't go to waste.

61
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,609
Say, the people of Tokyo
are surprisingly kind.

62
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,570
I wish we could get down there.

63
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,531
But even the stairway is packed
with people, so I guess it’s impossible.

64
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,448
But this is nice.

65
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,785
We can see better from here,
and we don’t have to risk our lives.

66
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,745
Anyway, what’s up with all
these people right from the beginning?

67
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,871
Impressive, huh?

68
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,748
It’s because they’re good.

69
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,625
This makes me feel lonely,
in a strange way.

70
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,670
With this popularity,
Nana may have forgotten about us.

71
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:59,215
But she sent us a postcard to notify us
of her upcoming concert.

72
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,884
That was a good call to hand her
that paper with your address on it.

73
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,762
You know, next time,
I say we skip school and work

74
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,180
and come to all the concerts,

75
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,598
even if we have to hitchhike!

76
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,892
I agree! Even if we need to camp out!

77
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:15,648
That’ll give us the strength
to work hard with other stuff.

78
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,611
At seven o’clock sharp,
the starting time of the concert,

79
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:25,116
the first one to appear on stage…
was Nana.

80
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:42,050
Absorbed in the cheers that got louder
with each concert,

81
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,844
I felt that I was disappearing
into the crowd.

82
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,057
Good evening. We’re BLAST.

83
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,979
Damn it, it’s begun!

84
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,690
Hey, I can hear it. They sure play loud!

85
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,150
I wanna go in!

86
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,486
BLAST should play in a bigger place!

87
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,571
Do you know what the population
of Tokyo is?

88
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,911
We should have purchased
tickets ahead of time.

89
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,204
We’ll wait and catch them
on their way out.

90
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,539
-Who do you wanna see?
-Yasu.

91
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,999
He has great technique.

92
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,585
No way! Yasu’s mine!

93
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,879
I’m guessing since it’s summer vacation,

94
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,464
so many people have come out here
from the suburbs,

95
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,632
causing this situation.

96
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,802
Even so, this level
of enthusiasm is crazy.

97
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,928
What is this?

98
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,638
What do you wanna do?

99
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,973
Wanna go for a coffee
until the concert’s over?

100
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,309
Sure. We’ve come all the way here.

101
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,936
Let’s stick around and meet up
with Nana later.

102
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,314
But with so many followers,

103
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,690
they should be able to go pro
without any problem.

104
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,359
That’s it! Their followers!

105
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:46,114
Misato’s one, and Nana has a bit
of that towards her roommate.

106
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,824
Yeah, you’re right.

107
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,159
Maybe the reason she no longer
talks about the Demon Lord

108
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,911
is not because she’s matured,

109
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,247
but because she’s switched over
to the BLAST religion.

110
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,457
Bottom line, she needs something
to depend on.

111
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,959
Well, at least she’s more positive now

112
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,878
than back when she’d blame everything
on the Demon Lord.

113
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,006
Besides, BLAST is really cool.

114
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,467
I can see why they have
such devoted followers.

115
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,095
Their presence on stage is
out of the ordinary.

116
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,849
You’re right. Especially that vocalist.

117
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,313
You know, I was thinking.

118
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:23,234
You know how with musicians,
talent alone doesn’t guarantee success?

119
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,987
Of course you’ve gotta
be above a certain level

120
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,823
if you’re gonna go pro.

121
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:33,744
But from that point on, it’s not really
about how good or bad you are.

122
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,126
Charisma.

123
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,043
GAIA RECORD CO. LTD.
PRODUCER TAKAFUMI KAWANO

124
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,046
Your band has that.

125
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,799
Your musical performance
and songs are exceptional.

126
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,843
It was a wonderful show.

127
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,638
I’ve been in this business
for a long time,

128
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,058
but I haven’t been so moved
to this extent for ages.

129
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,438
There’s a lot for us to discuss.

130
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,064
Rather than just talk things over here,
why don’t I…

131
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,858
take you out for sushi?

132
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,861
Yay! Sushi!

133
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,697
Shin.

134
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,662
What? You didn’t go meet them backstage?

135
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,789
No. They were seeing a guy
from a record company.

136
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,166
It would be distracting
to have outsiders there

137
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,459
while they’re discussing business.

138
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,419
We’ll be seeing everyone
at home later, anyway.

139
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,921
Oh, an after party?

140
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,215
Then we’re going straight
to your place, Nana?

141
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,468
Mm-hmm… I figured tonight will be
a night to celebrate,

142
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,303
so I prepared lots of food.

143
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,888
So please come.

144
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,806
Sorry, Nana.

145
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,518
We’re kind of busy now.

146
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,894
We’ve gotta get home right away.

147
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,647
Huh? Why? It’s summer vacation.

148
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,107
We have a group exhibition
starting next week.

149
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,361
Six of us have rented a gallery,
us and some friends from the Art College.

150
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,613
We’re super busy for the exhibition.

151
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,408
Is that so? A group exhibition?

152
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,118
Like a true art student.

153
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,621
I feel sorry that
you couldn’t see the concert

154
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,415
after coming out here during
such a busy time.

155
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,460
It’s not as bad as those who came
all the way to Tokyo from a different city

156
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,003
and weren’t able to get in.

157
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,129
Indeed.

158
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,466
Here. It’s a pamphlet with information
on our group exhibition.

159
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,134
Come by if you have time.

160
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,052
ART COLLEGE
OIL PAINTING 2

161
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,638
Friends studying the same thing.

162
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:20,101
Jun-chan and Kyosuke are working
diligently in their own world.

163
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,397
I feel an even stronger sense
that they’re leaving me behind.

164
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,028
Ms. Hachiko, your cell phone’s ringing.

165
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,907
Hello, Nana here.

166
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,117
Oh, Nana?

167
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,370
Good job with the concert.
We’re back home.

168
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,914
We got a ride home.

169
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,166
What about you guys, Nana?
What time can you get here?

170
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,044
Sorry. It doesn’t look like
we’re gonna be able to make it.

171
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,464
We’ve been invited to have dinner
with the guy from Gaia.

172
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,133
I imagine we’ll be pretty late.

173
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,972
Did you already make preparations
for our after-party?

174
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,933
No, not yet! We just got home!

175
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,436
I’m really sorry.

176
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,354
Not to worry.

177
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,816
It’s okay, don’t worry about us. Go.

178
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,444
This kinda stuff happens often.

179
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:15,906
I’m working tomorrow evening,
but I’ll stop by during the day.

180
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,909
Oh, but I have work
from the morning tomorrow.

181
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,703
What about Misato? Let me talk to her.

182
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,748
It’s Nana.

183
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,916
Hello?

184
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,920
Yes. Nana, it was an awesome performance.

185
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,048
Huh?

186
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,800
Oh? Is that so?

187
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,471
No, let’s hope they bring up
the subject of a contract.

188
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,307
Huh? Tomorrow?

189
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,643
What about me?

190
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,896
Yes, I’ll be waiting for you at home.

191
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,775
Hey, Nana, what about me?

192
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,909
Nana, Mr. Kawano’s
called for a taxi. Let's go.

193
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,536
They’re waiting in the street…

194
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,622
Oops. Sorry, you’re on the phone.

195
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,333
Sorry, Misato, I have to go now.

196
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,876
Say bye to Hachiko for me, okay?

197
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,463
Huh? Oh, go ahead.

198
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:16,467
Feel free to stay in my room.
The room’s not locked.

199
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,260
Mm-hmm. Bye.

200
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,263
Was that Misato? What about Hachi?

201
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,974
She said not to worry and go.

202
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,687
Misato and Hachiko should come
and join us for sushi.

203
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,523
You idiot. Let’s go.

204
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,274
Idiot?

205
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,279
Good job.

206
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,280
Oh!

207
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,282
Nana!

208
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,998
I live, encouraged by the songs you sing.

209
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,669
It’s only natural for Nana
to treat Misato,

210
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,004
who pursues Nana with passion

211
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,257
and makes the effort to come
all the way to Tokyo for every concert,

212
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,009
more importantly than she treats me.

213
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,096
It’s only natural for Nana to place
a higher priority on talks

214
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,850
with a record label than any promise
she made with me.

215
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,309
And it’s also only natural that

216
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,771
she would choose to be with Ren
than live with me.

217
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,399
It all makes sense.

218
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:20,364
But if that’s the case…
she no longer needs me.

219
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:25,828
It’s such a shame, Ms. Hachiko,
after making all this food.

220
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:26,829
Huh?

221
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,582
Oh, right!

222
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,041
It can’t be helped,
given the circumstances.

223
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,752
Don’t feel pressured into eating more
than you want, Misato.

224
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,297
But everything’s so delicious.
It would be hard not to overeat.

225
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:41,510
You’re a very good cook,
Ms. Hachiko. I’m impressed.

226
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,765
Misato is such a nice girl.

227
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,643
She is so much in love with Nana

228
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:53,063
yet will never show hostile sentiments
to those around her.

229
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,484
And she was honestly happy
about Nana and Ren.

230
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,944
She’s a really cute, good girl,

231
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:03,199
which exhausts me all the more
with my tendency to be cynical.

232
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,578
I wonder if we can get along
for a full month.

233
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,872
2. INBOX
3. OUTBOX

234
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:10,831
4. DRAFTS
5. SIGNATURE

235
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:11,790
TAKUMI

236
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,712
A FRIEND WILL BE STAYING WITH ME
DURING SUMMER VACATION,

237
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,797
SO DON'T COME BY MY PLACE, OKAY?
NANA

238
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:24,136
This is like telling him that I can’t
see him until summer vacation is over.

239
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,513
Well, I guess that’s fine.

240
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,056
Since being with him,

241
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,557
I’ve never been sure whether
or not I’ll ever see him again anyway.

242
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,729
I ended up not seeing Nobu again as well.

243
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:37,566
And while he was on stage,
I purposely tried not to look over to him.

244
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:47,826
Nana…

245
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,795
This isn’t good. What should I do?

246
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,673
I’m feeling so lonely.

247
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,474
Is your friend a woman?

248
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,853
Of course!

249
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,648
Really? Then that’s fine. Good night.

250
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,038
Yes.

251
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,164
Takumi…

252
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,042
I wanna see you.

253
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,342
Oh, Ms. Hachiko,
thank you for letting me take a bath.

254
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,429
I’m sorry, Misato.
I’m going out for a bit.

255
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,724
Huh? At this hour? Did something happen?

256
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:55,269
No. It’s nothing important,
but I won’t be coming home tonight.

257
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,479
I’ll be going straight to work
from there tomorrow.

258
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,689
I’ll leave my keys with you,

259
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,859
so leave them
in the mailbox downstairs when you go out.

260
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,947
Sorry to leave you alone.

261
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:11,994
But I just couldn’t make it
through the night tonight.

262
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,748
Bye, Takumi. I’ll come pick you up
tomorrow morning at ten.

263
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,000
Don’t you dare leave your room until then.

264
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,419
Yes. Thank you, Take.

265
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,880
Drop by my place and bring me
a change of clothes, okay?

266
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,006
Sure.

267
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,435
Sorry to keep you waiting, Reira.

268
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,103
-Take.
-Huh?

269
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,899
Get a room for me too.
I’m feeling carsick.

270
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,906
The price on the meter
is getting pretty high.

271
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,493
By the time I get there, it could be
as high as my wages for tomorrow.

272
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,330
ROOM 2015. JUST SO YOU KNOW,
IT’S NOT A SUITE.

273
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,165
THOSE ARE SPECIAL
FOR FIRST AND LAST STAYS ONLY.

274
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,840
Which means this isn’t
the last time, right?

275
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,970
Nobu, you were more popular
than me tonight.

276
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:14,515
-Thank you very much, Mr. Kawano.
-I don't understand.

277
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,183
The meal was exceptional.

278
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,977
How about another drink
somewhere around here?

279
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,604
No thank you.
I have to go to work tomorrow.

280
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:24,650
Right, you’re working
at a law firm, right?

281
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,860
What are you gonna do about that?

282
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,030
I’ll give it some serious thought
along with this issue about our contract.

283
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,408
I see. I’m hoping for a positive reply.

284
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,659
TAXI STOP

285
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:37,955
Yasu, I’m gonna take a taxi
with Nobu and Shin.

286
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,417
Hachiko said she’s working
from the morning tomorrow,

287
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,918
so I’ll drop by to see her tonight.

288
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,129
Yeah, that would be good.

289
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,755
Send her my apologies
for not being able to make it

290
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,298
to the after-party.

291
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:55,556
Mr. Kawano is such
a laid-back type of man, don’t you think?

292
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,308
At this rate, it’s gonna take us
one hundred years before our debut.

293
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,520
Does a man like that really understand
the likes of rock and punk?

294
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,024
Sure, he said that he was moved, but…

295
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,945
Still, he gave us money for the cab,
so I’m sure he’s a good man.

296
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:14,033
I’m not sure if that determines
whether or not he’s a good man.

297
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,326
Let’s split the change.

298
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,245
Excuse me! Stop here!

299
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,875
What is it?

300
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,086
Work? Where do you get all that energy?

301
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,255
Say hi to Hachi for me, Nobu.

302
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,262
-Are you planning on coming too?
-I’m not.

303
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,932
I give up. There are lots
of women out there.

304
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,267
And I’m pretty popular with the girls.

305
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,728
At least grow your hair, Nobuo.

306
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,272
I’ll get no pleasure winning
her over in that department!

307
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,774
Actually, I don’t think
it’ll look good on you.

308
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,233
Then don’t say it!

309
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,488
I’m back.

310
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,533
Sorry for waking you.

311
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,286
I forgot my key at my friend’s place.

312
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,204
REN'S PLACE?

313
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,414
No, it's fine. I was still awake.

314
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,874
What about Hachi? Has she gone to bed?

315
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,000
Ah…

316
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,670
Ms. Hachiko went out a short while ago.

317
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,256
Huh? Where could she have gone
at this hour?

318
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,676
I’m not sure,
but she suddenly left in a flurry,

319
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,012
saying she wouldn’t be returning tonight.

320
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:24,228
I might’ve done something
to upset her again.

321
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,480
No, it’s not that. I’m sure it’s a guy.

322
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,982
I’ll bet she went to see her boyfriend.

323
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,567
-Don’t worry.
-Huh?

324
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,486
-Is the beer cold?
-Yes.

325
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,698
So Ms. Hachiko has a boyfriend?

326
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,118
Why? Does it surprise you?

327
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,035
Yes!

328
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,453
"Yes," she says.

329
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:45,040
Because to me, it seemed that
Ms. Hachiko thinks only of you, Nana.

330
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,877
There’s no way.

331
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,547
But I think only of you, Nana.

332
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,716
Making remarks like that as
if it were impossible hurts my feelings.

333
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,053
I’m sorry.

334
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,098
What’s this?

335
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,599
Oh, it’s a microwave.

336
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,434
Well, I can tell that
by looking at it, but…

337
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,603
She said she got a loan to buy it.

338
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,981
Apparently, that was the only place
she could put it.

339
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,692
If she had that kind of money,
why not get an air conditioner?

340
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,111
Geez, that Hachi.

341
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,126
Say, what’s with this mountain
of leftovers in the fridge?

342
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:35,841
That… Actually, Ms. Hachiko figured
tonight would be a night to celebrate,

343
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,344
and she had already prepared this
before I arrived here.

344
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,181
Did you already make preparations
for our after-party?

345
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,350
No, not yet. Don’t worry about us and go.

346
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,648
I’m sorry.

347
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,735
No, you couldn’t help it, Nana.

348
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,529
Um, so how did it go
with the record company?

349
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,090
Hey, Nana…

350
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,845
For instance, if we were lovers,

351
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:26,058
would we have been able to fill
the gap between us with a hug?

352
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:37,152
Or… does everyone endure this loneliness?

353
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,050
It’s not that I wanted
to keep you all to myself, Nana.

354
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,721
I just wanted to be needed by you.
