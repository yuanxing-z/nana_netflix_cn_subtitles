1
00:00:01,876 --> 00:00:07,340
Back then, I wasn’t really able
to love someone properly.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,260
Yet I couldn’t help but want to be loved.

00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:26,735
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

4
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,857
What’s that supposed to mean?

5
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,530
You went to Nana’s place
because you were worried, right?

6
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,031
Then what good will lecturing her do?

7
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,033
But it just came out that way.

8
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:01,663
How can you say things so bluntly
to someone whose heart’s been shattered?

9
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,957
But I did it for Nana’s sake.

10
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,000
If so, you could’ve chosen a better time.

11
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,044
But there’s meaning in talking to her
about it now after what happened.

12
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,629
Welcome.

13
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,675
What? Hey Nobu, where’s Koichi Sato?

14
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,969
He caught a cold, so he’s off today.

15
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,680
Really? I guess, with the change
in temperature lately…

16
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,809
-Could we have two beers?
-Sure.

17
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,687
What are you doing
sneaking around like that, Shoji?

18
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:31,985
Don’t worry about me. My character
disappeared in the last episode.

19
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,528
You definitely didn’t disappear.

20
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,488
-I can see you just fine.
-That’s not possible…

21
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,115
-Drink with us.
-Watch it!

22
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,658
How naive of you.

23
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,369
You deserve to experience being
that character who gets hated

24
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,956
and despised by viewers
but still needs to make appearances.

25
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,334
I shouldn’t have come to Jackson’s.

26
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,503
What about work? Do you have the day off?

27
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,462
No, sir. If you must know,

28
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,590
I have the evenings off during
the "Golden Week" holidays.

29
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,216
Just talk normally.

30
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,634
I went to see Nana.

31
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,138
She really hates you,

32
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,641
so I suggest you don’t try to fix things
and just keep a low profile.

33
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,604
What do you mean by "fix things"?

34
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,689
Well, because Shoji says

35
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:14,277
he hates breaking up like this
and wants to talk things over with Nana.

36
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,280
-What does he want to talk to her about?
-Some excuses, perhaps?

37
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,657
No, it’s not like I wanna make excuses…

38
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:26,414
It’s just, I think
I should properly apologize to her.

39
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,874
Not a good idea!

40
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,542
If you have no intention
of getting back together with Nana,

41
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,085
you should clearly end this relationship!

42
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,171
You’ve gotta realize it’s your attitude,
trying to hold on to them both,

43
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,215
that hurt both Nana and Sachiko.

44
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,425
You still haven’t learned your lesson!

45
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,931
I don’t think you wanna apologize
to Nana out of kindness.

46
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:48,061
By apologizing,
you just wanna feel better about yourself.

47
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,607
Kyosuke, you’re being just as blunt,
you know.

48
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,567
Yeah? It’s ok.

49
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,571
My motto is to be kind to women,
strict towards men.

50
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,325
Nobu, I’ll leave the money here.

51
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:06,788
-You running away?
-No. You’re absolutely right.

52
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,165
-So on that note, I’m gonna disappear.
-Where to?

53
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,501
What are those flowers?

54
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,461
Don’t worry about it. Bye.

55
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,797
-Oh, Shoji!
-What?

56
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,465
Please, just let me leave.

57
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,592
That hat belongs to the store.

58
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,931
Thank you very much.

59
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,683
That was lame.

60
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,815
Apparently,
it’s his girlfriend’s birthday.

61
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,734
Sachiko’s? Oh, so that’s
what the flowers were for.

62
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:41,698
He was saying she’s working now,
but it’ll be her birthday at midnight,

63
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,409
so he wanted to be the first
to wish her a happy birthday.

64
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,202
That kid’s got a kind heart.

65
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:51,833
Well, well. He’s being all lovey-dovey
where we can’t see him.

66
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,209
Good for him.

67
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:57,171
That’s how it should be,
for Sachiko’s sake.

68
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,090
Oh, hello.

69
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:05,305
The main issue is with Nana,
especially with you lecturing her.

70
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,973
I just hope she’s still alive.

71
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:10,018
She’ll be fine! Tomorrow’s the day
of her roommate’s live concert.

72
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,021
She was really looking forward to that,
so she’ll be alive until then.

73
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,273
Besides, I promised her that
we’d drive her there in the evening.

74
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,693
But she might die after that.

75
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,779
Farewell.

76
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,284
Then that’ll probably also mean
the end of this series.

77
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,289
And I was so thrilled that
I started crying!

78
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,790
It’s the first row!

79
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,585
The first row at a Trapnest concert!

80
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,004
I get to see Takumi in person
from that close!

81
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,131
I feel so great I could just die!

82
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,758
Farewell…

83
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,303
But I can’t do that.
If I die, I can’t see him.

84
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,055
So there’s no way I can die until then.

85
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,015
-Thank goodness for that.
-Thank goodness for that.

86
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,684
Hey, if by any chance
Nana can’t come along,

87
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,602
you wanna come with me, Jun-chan?

88
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:58,149
Well… even in the front row,
I’m not particularly a fan of Trapnest.

89
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:01,069
Why not go? It’s just a live concert.

90
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,361
That’s no fun.

91
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,823
That’s exactly what Nana said.

92
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,034
She says "I’ll come if I’m in the mood",

93
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,329
then learning that the concert hall’s
far away, she says, "That’s such a drag."

94
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,207
-Far? Where exactly is it?
-At the Idea Hall.

95
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,461
-Idea Hall? You mean that place back home?
-Mm-hmm!

96
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:22,090
What? Why didn’t you get
tickets to the Tokyo performance?

97
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,092
Because back when I ordered them,

98
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,636
I still wasn’t sure
if I’d be able to come to Tokyo.

99
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,179
On top of that,
given the popularity of Trapnest,

100
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:31,516
even fan club members have a hard time
getting tickets for the Tokyo concert.

101
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,518
It would be totally sad
if I couldn’t get seats.

102
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:37,605
But I was sure I could get two tickets
for the concert back home.

103
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,149
And I figured I’d see them better than
from seats in Tokyo’s bigger concert hall.

104
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,819
I’m not going! It would be such a drag.

105
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,987
How come? You could also visit your folks,

106
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,322
so you’d be killing two birds
with one stone.

107
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,658
I don’t wanna visit my folks!

108
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,661
They’d only put me to work
in those rice fields!

109
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:55,623
Fine, then. I’ll ask Nana again.

110
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,334
She may talk in an unfriendly tone,
but inside, she’s really kind.

111
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,253
I’m sure she’ll agree to come.

112
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,881
You know, I’d think twice
about pressuring her to go.

113
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:07,885
Why not find a guy who’s a Trapnest fan
and go with him?

114
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:08,803
Yeah.

115
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,264
You’ll have a new boyfriend,
and you get to go to the concert.

116
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,058
That’s killing two birds with one stone.

117
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:19,730
I don’t want a boyfriend.
I’m through with love.

118
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,071
What are we gonna do?

119
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:31,325
You take love away from Nana,
and she’s got nothing left.

120
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,415
I have Nana, after all.

121
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,751
As long as I’m with Nana,
I won’t feel lonely.

122
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,921
Since we’re both women, we can be
ourselves in front of each other.

123
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,258
There’s no need to be jealous.

124
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,552
We can always be together
without worrying about that kinda stuff.

125
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,603
In comparison, love is
tiresome, hurtful, and never lasts.

126
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,313
I’ve had enough of it.

127
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,233
What I want is not a boyfriend

128
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,777
but a knight who will protect me.

129
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,904
But I know very well that

130
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,824
in the real world,
such a person doesn’t exist.

131
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,749
-This is loud!
-This is loud!

132
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,501
No way, it’s a full house!

133
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:25,796
I wanted to see them up close!
We should’ve come sooner!

134
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,635
What kind of event is this, anyway?
"Punk Night"?

135
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:34,013
-They’re all punk bands?
-What a dull title.

136
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:39,018
I think Nana’s band is after this one!
I’m gonna force my way to the front!

137
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,020
Hey, Nana, do you want a drink?

138
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,523
I don’t want one!
It’ll only get in the way!

139
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,363
Ow!

140
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,573
Oh, no, I can’t get through!

141
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:58,579
What is this weird vibe?
I can’t get into mood.

142
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,623
That singer’s not at all cool.

143
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,832
Thanks!

144
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,544
Lose some weight, man.

145
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,506
I guess they’re finished.

146
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,926
Nana’s next.
This is my chance to get closer.

147
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,136
Hey, wanna stick around for the next one?

148
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,430
"Black Stones"? Don’t know them.

149
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,891
"BLAST" for short? How lame.

150
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,268
How dare you!

151
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,644
Let’s go outside for a smoke.

152
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,604
The main guys have already performed.
Let’s go home!

153
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,689
Let’s go for a drink.

154
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:29,819
How come? Wait a minute,
everyone, don’t leave yet.

155
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:37,159
Hey, have you heard?
The next band is super cool!

156
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,379
What a cute girl.

157
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,882
Yes, I know! Blast is really cool!

158
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,969
There’s a girl who’s into them.

159
00:09:55,052 --> 00:10:00,057
Especially the vocalist, Nana!
She’s so powerful for a young woman!

160
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,518
Really? Is the next band a girl band?

161
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,688
Ah, no. The vocalist is a woman,

162
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,024
but the drummer and guitarist
play like pros.

163
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,483
This is their first concert in Tokyo,

164
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,653
but they were quite famous
back in their hometown.

165
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,072
-Wanna check them out?
-Sure.

166
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,784
Your blonde curls are really cute.
Are they fake?

167
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,286
No, they’re real.

168
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,079
Who is this girl?

169
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,041
Hey, you know,
I hear the next band is pretty good.

170
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,667
Huh? Really?

171
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,085
Why not stay just for the beginning?

172
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:32,131
Hey, they’re saying that the next band’s
really great. Let’s hear them play.

173
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,634
They’re that great?
In that case, let’s hear them.

174
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,845
-Are they?
-Well, I don’t know, but…

175
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,097
If they don’t perform well,
this could be embarrassing.

176
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,103
Looks like a lot of the people
have returned.

177
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,858
-Um…
-They’re coming!

178
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,039
What am I gonna do?
I’m getting really nervous.

179
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,877
My heart is beating so hard
that it could tear apart.

180
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:16,258
Hey, look at them.
That band looks pretty hot.

181
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,763
Yeah, but a band should be credited
not for its looks but for its sound.

182
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,823
What’s this? The floor is shaking.

183
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,660
Nana!

184
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:06,350
Good evening. We’re Blast.

185
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,647
Back home, she had some dedicated fans.

186
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,525
She was like a celebrity.

187
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,838
I could barely stand on my own two feet.

188
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,340
I felt that I was being left behind.

189
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,346
Nana’s songs all seemed
to consist of that same message.

190
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,353
I feel my eyes tearing up.

191
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,400
That’s exactly how I’m feeling.

192
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,905
Don’t leave me behind, Nana.

193
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,492
What a surprise!

194
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,328
You guys are really talented!

195
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,621
The other performances that
came up after you all

196
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,914
looked like those played by children
in a school band.

197
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,708
Sure, your sound is great,
but how do I put this?

198
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,461
You guys had this great aura emitting
from you when you took that stage.

199
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,921
Anyway, you were awesome.

200
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,548
Thank you, Mr. Kyosuke, Ms. Junko.

201
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:23,302
Nobu, you can drop the "Mr."?
We’re the same age as you after all.

202
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,012
Really? You are?

203
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,973
You’re really mature, so I expected you
to be about the same age as Yasu.

204
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,808
It's cause Nobu acts
like a kid for his age.

205
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,603
You’re pretty cool
as long as you don’t talk.

206
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,772
That’s a good call to have you
not talk on stage.

207
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,816
Um, Ms. Komatsu,

208
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,944
do you have plates
we can use to divide this for everyone?

209
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:43,739
Oh, we don’t have enough plates.
Just serve it like that.

210
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,449
-Okay.
-Misato!

211
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,827
-What did you make?
-A vinegar dish and salad.

212
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,248
I figured you’d want something light
after the concert.

213
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,959
Far out! You sure are thoughtful, Misato.

214
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,379
Leave the rest to Hachiko.
Come chat with us.

215
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,422
-But…
-It’s fine. It’s fine.

216
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,384
-There aren’t enough seats. Nobu, move.
-Yes.

217
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,802
What about my seat?

218
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:08,305
Did you come all the way out here
just to see them perform?

219
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,933
-Yes.
-You look so cute in that apron.

220
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,935
Shin, that’s my apron!

221
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,480
That’s great. You already
have such dedicated fans.

222
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,400
But I’m surprised that you found out
about the live concert.

223
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,402
We got this on a last minute call
to fill in an opening.

224
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,113
Nana called me and told me about it.

225
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,322
Is that so?

226
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:29,493
I just wanted to inform her.
I never expected her to actually come.

227
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,203
Should I not have come?

228
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,582
Why would you think that?
I’m happy you came.

229
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,209
-Have a seat.
-Thank you!

230
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,128
What’s with that
"Should I not have come?" nonsense?

231
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,546
That sounds stupid.

232
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,550
Does that girl seriously like Nana?

233
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,261
She was crying a lot at the live show.

234
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,805
But they’re both women. That’s just weird.

235
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,772
-I never imagined I’d feel any jealousy.
-Your blonde curls are nice.

236
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,192
I may be the weird one.

237
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,570
They're really cute.

238
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,447
Well then, see you. Good night.

239
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,616
Good luck with your band!

240
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,868
Hey Nobu, get up. We’re leaving.

241
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,871
No way. I don’t feel well.

242
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,707
Nobu really can’t handle his alcohol.

243
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,876
And you’re too unaffected by alcohol.

244
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,837
Hey, Nana. Let’s let Nobu crash here.

245
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,714
Sure, as you wish.

246
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,675
Well… I should be going now.

247
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,011
Huh? Where are you going, Misato?

248
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,556
I’ve booked a room in a hotel
near Tokyo Station.

249
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,017
Really? Then why don’t I get
a taxi and take you there?

250
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,478
What a relief. I thought
she was planning on staying here.

251
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,189
Cancel the hotel room. Just stay here.

252
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,816
That’s right.
You came all the way here after all.

253
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,360
No, it’s okay. I couldn’t.

254
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:48,155
There’s no need to hesitate. Nobu!
It’s decided. You go home now.

255
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,491
If you stay here, Misato won’t be safe.

256
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,909
That’s not fair!

257
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,412
Then I’ll stay at Nobu’s place tonight.

258
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,708
I can’t sleep.

259
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:04,588
Sure I know Nana’s not the type that
would force herself on another woman,

260
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,174
but what if Misato’s
into that sort of thing?

261
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,594
Maybe they’ll get carried away.

262
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,555
Nana was kinda drunk.

263
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,558
Her being in such a good mood
is proof she’s drunk.

264
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,521
But how do two women do it?

265
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,065
I guess Nana would be on top…

266
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:30,030
Oh, no! I almost imagined it!
I’d better find myself a boyfriend!

267
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:34,368
I must be sexually frustrated,
both mentally and physically.

268
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,538
That’s why I’m having
these inexplicable feelings.

269
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:43,043
I really am in need of a kind man
who will take good care of me.

270
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,881
But it’s such a burden going through
the process of finding a boyfriend.

271
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,675
And falling in love is exhausting.

272
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,971
First of all, I get too involved
when I fall in love.

273
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,724
I’m so involved that
I lose sight of everything.

274
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,268
That’s why things don’t work out.

275
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,687
It was like that with Mr. Asano too…

276
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,941
I can’t even picture his face anymore.

277
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:10,237
And I really liked him.
And it was the same with Shoji too.

278
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:16,201
I don’t wanna think about Shoji now.
I don’t wanna remember anything.

279
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,455
In the meantime,
how am I gonna spend the day tomorrow?

280
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,709
As long as I have work,
I could distract myself.

281
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,170
But I don’t work
until the day after tomorrow.

282
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,213
On the other hand, if I think
I’ve gotta put up with Ms. Sakagami

283
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,884
telling me how useless I am,
I really don’t wanna go.

284
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,930
I wanna look for another job
and quit this one right away.

285
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:40,559
No matter how much I think about it,
I’m just not suited for that workplace.

286
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:44,229
But I wonder, is there any place
in this world I’m suited for?

287
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,901
I envy Nana.

288
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,323
GOOD MORNING! I’M GOING TO
THE AMUSEMENT PARK WITH MISATO!

289
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,657
I BET YOU’RE ENVIOUS! HA HA HA!

290
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:02,539
Why not ask me?
I wanna go to the amusement park, too!

291
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,502
Anyway, I’m going out.

292
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,879
I know. I’ll go shopping.

293
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,340
I’ll buy clothes
and make up and everything I want.

294
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,217
I’m going on a shopping spree.

295
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,303
But I don’t have any money.

296
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,264
I put that 300,000 yen
from my mom in a CD deposit.

297
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,307
Hello.

298
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,350
The interest rate isn’t that great.

299
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,768
-I shouldn’t have done it.
-Um,

300
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:23,852
-I no longer care
-if you’re looking for that color…

301
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,521
about the home with the yard.

302
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,481
M-- Miss?

303
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:34,363
Why is the city full
of couples on vacation?

304
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,991
I’m going home.

305
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,956
It’s already seven o’clock.

306
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,875
I hardly did anything today.

307
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,461
Yet I’m really hungry.
What should I do about dinner?

308
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,381
Oh, I know. I’ll go to Jackson’s.

309
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:56,009
The people there know me,
so I won’t be lonely even if I go alone.

310
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:02,057
But Shoji also hangs out there.

311
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,350
I'm changing my mind.

312
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,477
I’ll go to the supermarket
and buy something to cook.

313
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,563
I’ve gotta spend less.

314
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:12,151
Misato’s in high school,
so she has class starting tomorrow.

315
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,486
I’m sure she’s on the train
returning home about now.

316
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,573
Then Nana could be back soon.

317
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:27,666
The ground meat’s on sale.
I’ll make hamburger steak.

318
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:43,432
Why must I run into her here?
Does she live around here too?

319
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:48,437
Or maybe she’s about to go
to Shoji’s place…

320
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,815
and cook in that kitchen…

321
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,284
You’re home, Hachiko. Where’d you go?

322
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:06,955
Hello. Great timing.
I just finished preparing dinner.

323
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,750
Look at her. Isn’t Misato super cute?

324
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,710
Nana bought this for me.

325
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,382
Wha…

326
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,639
Stop taking them away.

327
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,598
Hachi?

328
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,435
Everyone’s taking away
my places of comfort.

329
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,396
Is this girl gonna stay here tonight, too?

330
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,899
This is my home, too!

331
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,401
So don’t just do as you please, Nana!

332
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:48,121
That moment, I was convinced
Nana would be furious.

333
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,833
But she had the expression
of a scolded child.

334
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,296
Every time I think back about it,
it hurts me.

335
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:01,635
