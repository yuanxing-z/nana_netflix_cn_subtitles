1
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,633
At the time,
three years after their debut,

2
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:13,012
Trapnest had reached a million in sales,
both in the singles and album charts.

3
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,516
Their vocalist, Reira,
was in a class of her own

4
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:20,145
with a voice quality and range
exceptional for a Japanese singer.

5
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:23,148
Ren wrote almost all of their songs.

6
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:30,697
That day, for all two hours of the show,

7
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,325
my eyes were on Ren the whole time,
as if he was performing on his own.

8
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,245
I kept sending him telepathic waves,

9
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:44,419
hoping that he would
sense Nana’s presence.

10
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:52,093
At times, I felt Ren was looking this way,

11
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,642
but in an instant, his eyes
would wander off elsewhere.

12
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:23,875
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

13
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:30,293
Is he unreachable?
After coming all the way here?

14
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,918
Thank you very much.

15
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:26,057
Encore! Encore!

16
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,477
Encore! Encore!

17
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,855
The fans were great today.
They were really into our performance.

18
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,192
-Is this their national identity?
-You mean prefectural identity.

19
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,736
We’re not on a world tour.

20
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,197
Please don’t bother talking
to the audience on stage, Naoki.

21
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,365
It exposes your lack of intelligence.

22
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,617
Let’s add songs to our encore.

23
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,619
Two more songs don’t feel like enough.

24
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,372
But we haven’t rehearsed.
Don’t be ridiculous.

25
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,083
That’ll be impossible.
We’re approaching our time limit here.

26
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,419
We’re not renting
this hall for free, you know.

27
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:58,131
For a manager,
you can be really stingy, Take.

28
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,635
Reira, you shouldn’t talk either.

29
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,727
Hey, Ren, you know
you made a mistake in the second song.

30
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,979
You might’ve thought you got away with it,
but that was pretty obvious…

31
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,731
Where are you going, Ren?

32
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,898
To take a piss!

33
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:21,362
Where’d he make a mistake?
I didn’t notice anything.

34
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,614
So even Ren can make a mistake, I guess.

35
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:27,827
Notice it, damn it.
What is it with our band members?

36
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:34,250
Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore!

37
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:39,088
Hasn’t Ren noticed that you’re here?

38
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,009
He’s not likely able to see the audience
with all those spotlights.

39
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,386
-Really?
-Well, I can’t speak from experience.

40
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,096
I’ve never performed on a stage this big.

41
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,931
No way! He can't see us?

42
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,517
But we’re sitting in the first row.
Can’t he see a little?

43
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,102
Oh, this may be a trap
set up by the Demon Lord.

44
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,357
It must feel really good,
singing in such a big place.

45
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,323
You’ll be able to…

46
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,367
Being you, Nana, I’m sure you will.

47
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,623
The band BLAST will surpass Trapnest!

48
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,386
-Yes.
-Yasu, Nana’s here!

49
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,058
Right. Is the concert over already?

50
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,519
It’s not over.
We’re about to go out for the encore.

51
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,938
Well, good luck with that.

52
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,857
You knew about this, didn’t you?
Why didn’t you tell me?

53
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,526
I wanted it to be a surprise.

54
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,861
Then you succeeded.
I even made a mistake on stage.

55
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,822
Although I faked it
with a little rearrangement.

56
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,533
Really? That’s even more than
I could’ve asked for.

57
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,617
It’s not a laughing matter!

58
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,120
If it were in Tokyo, that’s one thing,

59
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,830
but what’s she doing
out here in the countryside?

60
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,331
Not to mention the front row.

61
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,708
Then jump off the stage and embrace her.

62
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,876
You can’t expect me to do that!

63
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,004
Ren! What are you shouting about?

64
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,798
Don’t lose it yet.
We’re not done with the performance!

65
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,842
We're going out for the encore.

66
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:10,638
Go. I’ll email you the cell number
of the girl Nana’s with.

67
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,808
If you wanna see Nana, call that number.

68
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,648
How can I face her after what happened?

69
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,822
I’m tired of hearing you say that.
You can be such a drag sometimes.

70
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,284
If you don’t intend to see her…

71
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,286
I’ll take Nana for myself.

72
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,790
Ren, we’re going!

73
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,889
Welcome home. You must be hungry.

74
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,641
Dinner is ready.

75
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,313
They played two songs for the encore.

76
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:04,275
Ren didn’t glance over our way even once.

77
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:10,531
This is making me really nervous,
having a meal with such a cute girl.

78
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,616
A cute girl?

79
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,536
What are you saying, Dad?
You perverted old man.

80
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,123
What! You’re one to talk,
with that Tarzan outfit.

81
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,751
-Tarzan?
-Go back to the jungle!

82
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,547
It was as if I had awakened from a dream.

83
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,511
We were reminded once and for all
that Ren is now a superstar

84
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,348
and out of our reach.

85
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,183
It made me feel miserable.

86
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,562
That was refreshing.

87
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,523
The bath’s available, Nana.

88
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,024
I left towels out for you.

89
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,693
Sure. Thanks.

90
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,225
Oh, darn! I forgot to switch it back on.

91
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,893
ONE UNREAD MESSAGE

92
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,061
FROM: YASU
SUBJECT: CONFIDENTIAL

93
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,229
Yasu?

94
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,315
That’s unusual. What could it be?

95
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,363
REN MIGHT BE GIVING YOU A CALL.

96
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,957
Nana! Big news!

97
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,960
You know, you shouldn’t barge in
when someone’s taking a bath…

98
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,378
But this really is big news!

99
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,629
Another murder?

100
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,382
No! Look here! Yasu sent me an e-mail!

101
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,592
Yasu?

102
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,013
Sorry, Nana! I forgot
to switch my phone back on

103
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,056
because it had to be
switched off in the hall.

104
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,351
It’s past midnight.
He may have tried to call.

105
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,979
What’s the meaning of this?
Why would Yasu…

106
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,107
I don’t know.
Maybe Yasu gave Ren my number.

107
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,526
But Ren was unreachable, wasn’t he?

108
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,571
I don’t really understand,
but what should we do?

109
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,993
Call Yasu.

110
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,921
-Hello.
-Hello, Yasu. It’s me.

111
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:35,301
Hello, Nana. Sorry about
giving out your number without asking.

112
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,427
No problem.

113
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,637
Did Ren call?

114
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,763
I’m not sure.

115
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,640
Did you check your missed calls?

116
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,768
I forgot to turn
the phone back on after the concert.

117
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,645
-What?
-I wonder if Ren’s already called.

118
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,146
Who knows?

119
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,898
What’ll I do?

120
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,734
Just wait and I’m sure he’ll call again.

121
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,652
Really?

122
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,947
Probably. I provoked him a bit.

123
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,408
Don’t joke around, baldy!

124
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,663
I don’t know what you told Ren,
but mind your own business.

125
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,499
I have nothing to say
to him at this point.

126
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,667
Well, let me make one thing clear.

127
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,171
It was he who called me
after noticing you at the concert hall.

128
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,008
I just gave him the phone number.

129
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,886
If you have nothing to say to him,
tell him that directly.

130
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,972
If you have no need for the key
to the place you and Ren used to live

131
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:27,144
and the key to the padlock
around Ren’s neck, just get rid of them.

132
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,105
That would put an end to everything.

133
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,899
Put yourself in his shoes.

134
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:35,194
He’s bound by a woman
he can never have again.

135
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,208
I understand.

136
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,420
Give me Ren’s cell number.

137
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,089
I’m not the type to sit around and wait.

138
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,100
FROM: YASU
GOOD JOB TODAY.

139
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,810
THIS IS NANA KOMATSU'S NUMBER

140
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:13,732
If you don’t intend to see her,
I’ll take Nana for myself.

141
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,833
Ren!

142
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:43,095
Hey, give me one too.

143
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,138
Stop it.

144
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,682
Oh, never mind.

145
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,811
I can’t sleep, so I’m going
to Takumi’s room to play cards.

146
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,812
Wanna come?

147
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,230
Cards again?

148
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,774
Yes. We’re playing Shichi Narabe again.

149
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,611
Not the image of rock musicians, is it?

150
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,072
I’m fine. I’ll pass.

151
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,949
Being a rock musician and all.

152
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,453
Let’s play! It’s no fun without you.

153
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,831
Takumi, Naoki and Take are
all lousy players.

154
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:14,668
It’s no fun winning all the games.

155
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:19,590
Sorry, but I’m really tired.
I’m going to bed. Good night.

156
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,551
Is that so? Darn.

157
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,263
-Reira.
-Huh?

158
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,266
Your voice is a bit rough. You okay?

159
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,730
Let’s do our best, okay? Sixteen to go.

160
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,641
-Who is it?
-Nana.

161
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:22,194
What a way to greet me.
You seem to be well.

162
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,700
I have something to talk to you about.
Can we meet now?

163
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,370
Sure.

164
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,663
Where are you now?

165
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,498
In my hotel room.

166
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,709
-Alone?
-Yeah.

167
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,836
Would it be unwise for me to go there?

168
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,795
No.

169
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,672
If you’d rather meet me
outside somewhere, just tell me where.

170
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,174
No, that would be less convenient.

171
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,385
It doesn’t look like
I’ll be able to leave here.

172
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,928
Then I’m coming right now.

173
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,681
What hotel and what’s the room number?

174
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,421
So many fans…

175
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,465
They’ve found out
where the band’s staying.

176
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,716
No wonder he can’t go out.

177
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,581
What does Nana plan
to do once she meets Ren?

178
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,834
What’s she gonna tell him?

179
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,672
Nana’s really stubborn, which worries me.

180
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,175
I’m so worried that
it’s not likely I’ll get any sleep.

181
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,490
Good job.

182
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,952
Are you a staff member? Show me your pass.

183
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,122
Oh, my pass?

184
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:42,418
It must be tough,
having to check passes here as well.

185
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:48,132
Oh? I think I left
it in my room. I’ll go get it.

186
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,426
This area is off limits to the public.

187
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,428
It’s a real problem.

188
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,846
Do you have any idea

189
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,808
how much trouble obsessed fans
like you cause the band members?

190
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,435
I’m not really a fan!

191
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,812
Now go on. Go on home.

192
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,733
I asked that girl to come.

193
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,610
Please let her through. Here’s
a little payment to keep it a secret.

194
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,071
Oh, is that so? Well, sorry about that.

195
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,635
The security’s really tight.

196
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,805
Sorry, maybe I shouldn’t have come.

197
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,152
Ren…

198
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,488
Let me go!

199
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,531
I have no intention
of getting back together with you!

200
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,574
I wanted to see you.

201
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,092
I shouldn’t have come.

202
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,438
You’re ingenious, Yasu.

203
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:31,610
Knowing Nana, naturally she’s gonna
feel the need to give the keys back to Ren

204
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,153
after what you told her.

205
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,071
Hey, I’ll take that! Pon.

206
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:37,282
But if she gives him the keys,
it would be over between them?

207
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,118
If she really wanted to end it with him,

208
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,870
she wouldn't go through the trouble of
meeting him just to hand over some keys.

209
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,581
It just gives them an excuse to meet.

210
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,501
They’re man and woman.
Let that take care of the rest.

211
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:51,088
Shin, not that I care,
but you’ve been acting saucy lately.

212
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,215
Don’t be so snobbish.

213
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,800
-Oh, that’s Ron for me!
-Huh?

214
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,553
-Did I win?
-He’s good.

215
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:01,557
You tricked me. You are so not cute.

216
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,809
Mahjong is so much fun.

217
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,519
Next time,
we should play with four people.

218
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,812
Does Nana play too?

219
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,314
Yeah. We used to play
a four-person game a lot

220
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,774
when Ren was around.

221
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,402
Say, let’s ask Ren over next time.

222
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,405
Really? I can meet Ren? I wanna see him!

223
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,823
I wanna see him too!

224
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:22,077
Why is it you're always
secretly meeting Ren behind my back?

225
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,163
I’m always left out.

226
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,416
-Ren doesn’t have the guts to see you.
-Huh?

227
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:31,503
So he feels guilty about leaving BLAST.

228
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,674
He initially declined Trapnest’s offer,
you know.

229
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,595
Then Takumi gave me a call.

230
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,723
I was the one who persuaded Ren to join.

231
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:46,810
Still, he feels that he betrayed us.

232
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:51,190
There’s no need for him to fuss
over something that happened in the past.

233
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,649
It doesn’t suit him.

234
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,527
But that’s Ren for you.

235
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,904
Can a guy so awkward with people

236
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,615
really make it
in the brutal world of entertainment?

237
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,366
It worries me.

238
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:06,455
Well, in that case,
why don’t I send him an email?

239
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,166
-An invitation to a mahjong tournament.
-Yay!

240
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,210
He’ll be so happy that he’ll cry.

241
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:15,547
By the way, Yasu,
you said you provoked Ren on the phone.

242
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,465
What did you say?

243
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:20,344
What tactics did you use?
Tell me so I can learn for myself.

244
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,013
I don’t really have any tactics.

245
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,932
Can’t you tell the level of my stupidity?

246
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:28,393
But you’re really smart! Unlike Nobu.

247
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,562
It’s not about how smart I am.

248
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,524
You still have a lot to learn.

249
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:47,496
Back then, I thought
I’d never wanna fall in love again.

250
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:54,044
But that night, I wanted to dream again.

251
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,880
I wanted to love someone
from the bottom of my heart,

252
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,592
no matter how I may get hurt,
no matter how I may suffer.

253
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:07,724
That’s what I felt that night
while praying for your happiness, Nana.
