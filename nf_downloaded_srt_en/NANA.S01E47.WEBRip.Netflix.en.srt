1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:06,798
If I saw everyone again right now…

2
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:11,678
I know that I’d depend on them
just as much as I did back then.

3
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,015
I’m scared of that.

4
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,226
That’s why I can’t move from this spot.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,357
Hey, Nana.
The midsummer flowers will bloom

6
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,860
along Tamagawa again this year.

7
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:32,115
We’ll all be waiting for you in room 707.

8
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:37,537
I even made matching yukatas for us.

9
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:06,399
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

10
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,557
Satsuki!

11
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,437
If you keep dawdling like that,
I’m going ahead!

12
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,439
Mommy!

13
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,108
-A butterfly! There was a butterfly!
-Huh?

14
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,985
It was big and black and really pretty!

15
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,946
It’s a famous butterfly!
I saw it in my book!

16
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,160
That must’ve been a black swallowtail.

17
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,079
A black swallowtail? It’s not a butterfly?

18
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,666
It is a butterfly.
But that kind is called a swallowtail.

19
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,211
A swallowtail?

20
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,505
How’s it different
from a normal butterfly?

21
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:40,678
Oh boy. Lately, talking
to Satsuki reminds me

22
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,597
of talking to Shin in the old days.

23
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,057
Why?

24
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,435
I guess it’s because he was
like a six-year-old.

25
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,939
What about me?

26
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,316
Shin, you look fabulous!

27
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,109
That looks great on you!

28
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,321
Really? How do I tie this thing?

29
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,156
I’ll tie it for you.

30
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,825
Then make a butterfly bow like yours.

31
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,537
Not allowed.
And this is not a butterfly bow.

32
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:10,291
It’s called a Hanabunko.
It’s how young girls tie their obi.

33
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,710
Really?
Then you can’t wear it either, Hachi!

34
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:13,920
Shut up.

35
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:23,054
Today’s the day
of the annual Tamagawa fireworks festival.

36
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,599
No matter how busy we are,

37
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:31,020
on this one day, we meet up in this room…

38
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,608
carrying the same pain inside.

39
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,116
Ah, that’s enough for me.

40
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,662
If I start drinking this early in the day,
I won’t make it to the fireworks.

41
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,500
But Yasu, you haven’t changed one bit.

42
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,710
You’re like a living fossil.

43
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,255
It’s not like I’d change
in just a few months.

44
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:01,009
No, you haven’t changed at all
since high school.

45
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,219
So I bet you’d be the same
if you lived a thousand years.

46
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:07,015
You haven’t changed much either, Nobu,
including your height.

47
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,641
Shut up!

48
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,892
Nobu.

49
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,271
Why don’t you go take a quick shower
and change into your yukata?

50
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:16,316
Oh, thanks! In fact,
would you mind filling the tub for me?

51
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,902
All right. Very well, young master.

52
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,656
Hey, what about Ren today?
Isn’t he coming?

53
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,867
He’ll be here in time for the fireworks.

54
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,536
He sure doesn’t hurry for anyone,
as always.

55
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,788
Here you go, Satsuki!
I bought you a present!

56
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,498
&lrm;YUMEKO

57
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,750
Yumeko-chan!

58
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,251
-What about for me?
-I have nothing!

59
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,003
Mommy, look! Yumeko-chan!

60
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,546
And she’s wearing a yukata!

61
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,464
RETRO DRESS-UP DOLL

62
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:45,094
So cute! Thank you, Nobu!
I love this Retro Doll series!

63
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,763
I didn’t buy it for you!

64
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,808
Isn’t that great, Satsuki?
Say thanks to the old man.

65
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,185
Old man?

66
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,227
YUMEKO SERIES 7

67
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,729
Thank you very much!

68
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:05,156
The flow of time cleanses the past
and heals the wounds in people’s hearts.

69
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:09,494
But there are wounds that
cannot be healed.

70
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:16,709
This room is just like it was then,
as if time had stopped.

71
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,180
Nana, listen. It’s about Nobu.

72
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,934
What about Nobu?

73
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,150
Nana?

74
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,196
What are you doing?

75
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,449
Citron bath salts.
They smell great, don’t you think?

76
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,206
You don’t need to worry so much.
I’m fine now.

77
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,587
It’s hot…

78
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,012
I put out a towel for you, young master.

79
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,899
Nana…

80
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,737
There are so many things
I wanna talk to you about now.

81
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:32,702
But in this apartment,
all I can see are memories.

82
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,890
-What’s this? It’s awesome!
-Super view!

83
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,975
If we can see them from the room,

84
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,019
I guess there was no need
for the disguises.

85
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,395
Yeah.

86
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,148
Hey! Where’s Hachiko? Why isn’t she here?

87
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,109
Maybe Takumi found out
and told her not to come.

88
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:09,447
Nah. That guy’s not one to fuss over
something like going to see fireworks.

89
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,242
She’ll be here eventually.
No news is proof that she’s safe.

90
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,869
No, it’s proof that something’s wrong!

91
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:44,482
I have to get going. Everyone’s waiting.

92
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:51,405
If I break this promise,
I will be a traitor for sure this time.

93
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,911
But I can’t stop crying.

94
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,162
Bye.

95
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:04,126
I thought I’d feel better
once we talked things over.

96
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,379
But now I realize that

97
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:10,967
I felt the most comfortable
when I was with Shoji.

98
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,680
We were good friends before we went out.

99
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,682
I thought that
once the break-up drama died down,

100
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,601
things could go back
to the way they used to be.

101
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:28,025
But now I’ve really lost him forever.

102
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,989
I should’ve treasured him more back then.

103
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,959
SHIN

104
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,170
What should I do?

105
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,338
If I see Nobu now,

106
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,300
there’s no way I could talk to him
and act normal.

107
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,344
I’ll get sad and start crying
all over again.

108
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,598
Those with a record
must refrain, you know.

109
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,475
What should I do?

110
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:07,148
But I don’t ever wanna betray them
again without saying anything.

111
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,902
If I can’t go,
then I have to tell them that.

112
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,784
Hello, Hachiko?

113
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,330
Nana?

114
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,790
Where are you?

115
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,752
Near Jackson’s.

116
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:31,339
I see. Well, hurry up!
The fireworks have already started.

117
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,971
I’m sorry. I don’t think… I can go…

118
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,475
Why not?

119
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:48,481
Hey, why are you crying?
Is something wrong?

120
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:51,984
I’m so…

121
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,822
scared of… seeing Nobu.

122
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:17,343
It’s all right. Nobu isn’t here.

123
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:29,980
You know, that guy has no guts.

124
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:34,902
He backed out at the last minute.
What a chicken.

125
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,948
So you’ve got nothing to worry about.
Hurry on over.

126
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,909
Shin and Yasu are really
looking forward to seeing you!

127
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,621
Don’t be so cold by telling us
you can’t come now.

128
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:51,377
I wanna see you, Hachiko. So hurry.

129
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,673
Okay.

130
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,101
Where are you going, Nobu?

131
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,353
I’m going home.

132
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,815
If she says she doesn’t wanna see me,
then I can’t stay.

133
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,401
She didn’t say that!

134
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:19,488
She says she’s scared to see you.
Hachi’s still in love with you!

135
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,740
Stop twisting things around
to how you want them to be!

136
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,744
No, I just know what it’s like
to be so scared

137
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:29,081
of being swept away again!

138
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,128
She’s marrying Takumi in two weeks.

139
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,463
It’s right around the corner.

140
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,882
But if you two fell back in love now,

141
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,800
Hachi would be stuck
in an impossible situation!

142
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,802
Of course she’s scared!

143
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,974
All the more reason
why I shouldn’t see her.

144
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,601
Can’t you just get stuck with her?

145
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:00,696
Forget it.

146
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,033
After all, you probably just wanted
to comfort Hachi

147
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,952
who had been dumped by her old boyfriend

148
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,704
and was being used by Takumi.

149
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,624
-You never really loved her.
-I do love her!

150
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,791
What do you know?

151
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,836
But now you love
that girl next door, right?

152
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,381
I hear that girl has
the same condition as me.

153
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,343
She can’t even go to work
without her medication.

154
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:26,222
So what?
She’s trying her best in spite of that!

155
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:31,602
Since long ago,
you’ve always loved helpless girls

156
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:35,731
who are stuck in some sort of situation
you had absolutely nothing to do with.

157
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,818
That way, you can always play
the part of the hero, right?

158
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,612
Nana, cut it out.

159
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,657
But then, the moment you feel
you’re being pulled in,

160
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,659
you let go of her hand.

161
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:50,037
Nobu, she’s just provoking you.
Don’t mind her.

162
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,338
What an easygoing form of love.

163
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:17,273
Nana can be really cruel.

164
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,443
She’s purposely trying to push them
into an impossible situation.

165
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,903
Of course Nobu would react

166
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,906
and get serious from the way
he was confronted.

167
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,784
Hachi’s gonna end up suffering even more.

168
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,081
Nobu is a pacifist.

169
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,710
He’s always tried his hardest to choose

170
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,422
the path that would make everyone happy.

171
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,927
I don’t think trying to avoid conflict
is the same as being easygoing.

172
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,432
I agree.

173
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:56,020
After all, it’s a battle
against his own desires.

174
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,028
What would you like?

175
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,947
Miss? How many do you want?

176
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,158
Three.

177
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,923
I’ll do everything I can
to make you happy.

178
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,198
I wanna see you, Hachiko.

179
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,244
So hurry.

180
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,047
If you two fell back in love now,

181
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,257
Hachi would be stuck
in an impossible situation.

182
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,902
It’s been a while
since I’ve seen fireworks.

183
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,487
They sure are pretty.

184
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,864
This is the first time I’ve ever had
food from a food stand.

185
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,074
-What?
-What?

186
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,618
It’s pretty good!

187
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,663
But it’s hard to eat with chopsticks.

188
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,082
I wonder if any of the stands have forks.

189
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,334
D-- Don’t spoil him! Make him practice!

190
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,627
Don’t grab me so suddenly!

191
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,212
My wig will shift!

192
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,130
HACHI

193
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,133
-Your wig!
-Hello?

194
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,636
-Shin?
-Yeah, what is it?

195
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,222
I'm at the apartment,
but no one’s answering.

196
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,726
Have you all gone ahead
to see the fireworks?

197
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,939
But the light’s on in the room.

198
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,357
Where are you?

199
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,359
Shin?

200
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,741
Yeah. We couldn’t wait
any longer and left. Sorry.

201
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,119
No, I should be the one apologizing
for being late.

202
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:21,165
I’ll head over there right now.
Where are you watching it from?

203
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,919
Yeah. Got it.
I’ll call again if I can’t find you.

204
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,839
What? You’re dressed as a girl?

205
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,318
Can’t you just get stuck with her?

206
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,080
What an easygoing form of love.

207
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,415
Over here!

208
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,918
Huh? No way! Shin? You’re so cute!

209
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,669
Come on! Everyone’s here.

210
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,968
They’re so pretty! Awesome!

211
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,637
They really are pretty, aren’t they?

212
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,641
Come on, Shin.
You’re sounding like Misato!

213
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,102
What a huge diamond.

214
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:30,234
You know, Nobu aside, why aren’t you
inviting me to your wedding?

215
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,819
You did invite Yasu and Shin.

216
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,612
Huh? You’d come?

217
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,614
Of course I would.

218
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,367
I’ll even sing you the punk version
of Ladybugs’ "Samba".

219
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,119
What’s that? What kind of song is it?

220
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,246
I’ll buy you the CD

221
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,956
so you can arrange it
and play the guitar part.

222
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,375
You be happy, no matter what, okay?

223
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,257
Nobu stepped aside so that you’d be happy.

224
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,052
So if you end up unhappy,
it was for nothing.

225
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,558
Well, with Takumi as your husband,

226
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,477
I’m sure he’s gonna make you cry
from time to time.

227
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,271
But you’re the fool who fell
in love with him,

228
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,397
so that can’t be helped.

229
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:13,902
And don’t get discouraged when he cheats
on you now and then, all right?

230
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,072
Just smack him around
until you feel better.

231
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,955
Yeah. You’re right.

232
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,542
Thank you, Nana.

233
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:36,758
That day, the riverside was packed
with people,

234
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,970
and I never saw Shoji and his girlfriend.

235
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,266
I felt that the curtain had finally
come down on our relationship.

236
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:46,935
There was such a big crowd

237
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,980
that you could easily lose sight
of the people you were with.

238
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:53,025
So I wanted to hold Nana’s hand…

239
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,360
But I was worried she’d think
I’m insensitive

240
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:59,489
if I innocently grabbed her hand,
which was as warm as Nobu’s.

241
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,578
The wind blowing on my fingertips
was freezing cold.

242
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:09,708
Come to think of it,
summer ended long ago, didn’t it?

243
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,882
Did you guys have fun at the fireworks?

244
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,426
Get ready to continue working hard!

245
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,511
Huh?

246
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,315
Hey, Nana.

247
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,195
That summer you longed for
more than anyone,

248
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:42,157
the one we couldn’t get back,
is right here.

249
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,202
I’ll always be waiting.

250
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:51,667
For ten years… twenty years… fifty years…

251
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,752
Hey, Nana…
