1
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:05,422
I thought the way she talked was
like the way she sang.

2
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:11,136
That unique and annoying way Takumi
stretches the last word when he speaks

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,847
was practically identical
to Reira’s rhythm.

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:19,936
It's like how I started to sound like Ren
before I even knew it.

5
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,334
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

6
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,994
You're kidding!

7
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,664
Come on, stop it!

8
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:07,168
Are those two sleeping together?

9
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,714
I wouldn’t be surprised,
no matter how many women Takumi has,

10
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,217
but if Reira were one of them,
I’d feel awful for Hachi,

11
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,262
who’s preparing miso soup
and waiting for him at home.

12
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,932
Damn…

13
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:25,520
The scab deep in my heart
is peeling off again.

14
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,857
I was so close to escaping
those miserable days

15
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,401
of thinking only of Hachi.

16
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,652
I’m reminded of it,

17
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:36,281
every time I look at the smug look
on Takumi’s face,

18
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:41,119
of how worthless I was
adding to Hachi's worries

19
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:47,083
when she was feeling her most vulnerable.

20
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,545
The talk will last about three minutes.

21
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,214
Please start by introducing
the band members.

22
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,132
Okay.

23
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,885
After that, we’ll ask
about your upcoming plans.

24
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,679
The questions will be what
we told you ahead of time.

25
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,472
Yes, I understand.

26
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,849
In fact…

27
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:06,269
Would you ask her what she thinks of me?

28
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,438
Yes, we would definitely like to ask that!

29
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,815
Shut up! And stop talking in harmony!

30
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:15,612
Girl, you can’t talk back
to the MCs like that!

31
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,238
Talk as little as possible
when you're on air.

32
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,156
And be cool, okay?

33
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,324
Like I care!

34
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,034
It’s Ren’s fault for making
such a stupid remark.

35
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,578
Aren’t you eating, Nobu?

36
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,288
I’m surprised you can eat
right before the show.

37
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,124
Oh my, you’re nervous?
You’re such a weakling.

38
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,542
Leave me alone.

39
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,796
I get nervous just like anybody else
when I do something I’m not accustomed to,

40
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,132
like stand in front of a TV camera.

41
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,467
Thirty seconds to the PR slot…

42
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,135
-When I think of how I will be exposed…
-before the show!

43
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,263
to the vast number of curious eyes,

44
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,140
it scares me.

45
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,267
Twenty seconds.

46
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,645
So I secretly imagine…

47
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:55,652
I imagine Hachi watching over me,
in that room before it became empty.

48
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:59,155
Ten seconds. Eight… seven…

49
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,701
It’s a charm to get rid of my anxiety.

50
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,999
Coming up, "Music Studio"! Broadcast live!

51
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,044
There she is!
Nana looked right at me and smiled!

52
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,254
Did you see that, Jun-chan?

53
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,507
I don’t think she was
specifically smiling at you.

54
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,176
I can’t see with you sitting there.
Please move.

55
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,014
You know, your own husband is
on the show too, right?

56
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,100
Never mind Takumi.

57
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,519
I can see him any time,
and every inch of him too.

58
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,645
So you’ve seen enough of him?

59
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,690
You see, every time he appears
in front of the media,

60
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,692
he tries to be cool,
and it’s like he’s a different person.

61
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,652
I get embarrassed watching him.

62
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,446
But you were a big fan
of that guy acting cool.

63
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,115
Are you showing off the fact
you’re close to him now?

64
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,866
Well, I can’t help it!

65
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,578
Takumi’s the closest person to me now!

66
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,581
But on that same account,
you’re really close to BLAST, too.

67
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:54,627
But you're just like an average fan
when it comes to the guru.

68
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,170
It’s really annoying!

69
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:00,341
It’s because I can only watch Nana
from a distance,

70
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,678
so I can’t do any more than worry
about her and cheer her on.

71
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,306
Which puts me in practically
the same position as the fans.

72
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,432
I find it lonely.

73
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,143
Well, I’m sure she’s really busy,

74
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,021
so she’s not likely to have any time
to be looking after you.

75
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,649
I don’t need her to look after me.

76
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,361
I just feel lonely that
she doesn’t rely on me.

77
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,824
They’re starting the countdown
to the show.

78
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:29,329
I’m gonna let Hachi feel relieved
by being calm.

79
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,706
Good evening!
I’m your host, Chie Takahashi!

80
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:32,707
And I’m Tsuyoshi Morishita!

81
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,126
I hear that the host with the big boobs
and the announcer

82
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,711
are having an extramarital affair.

83
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,337
-Those boobs have gotta be silicone.
-For the next hour,

84
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,214
we’re bringing you a great lineup
of fabulous guests tonight!

85
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,299
You’re gonna watch it here?

86
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,760
You have a TV in your own room, Yuri.

87
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,095
-But I wanna see them on a big screen!
-Without further ado,

88
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,014
-You know, like Nobu.
-let us invite our guests onstage!

89
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,017
First up! In their first appearance,
welcome to The Black Stones!

90
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,273
-Who’s that?
-Nobu’s totally the coolest.

91
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,484
Really? I think he looks the most normal.

92
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,612
Normally, all I see are
the street-smart guys,

93
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:06,407
so I’m really drawn to guys like Nobu
who look healthy and pure-hearted.

94
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,869
Don’t teach him any naughty games, Yuri.

95
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,287
The same goes for you, Myu.

96
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,122
You’ve done it with him, right?
How was he?

97
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,625
We haven’t done anything.

98
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,881
But you two are always talking
like you’re really close.

99
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,176
It’s not like that.
That kid’s still only twenty.

100
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,260
No way!

101
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,721
From my point of view, he’s still a kid.

102
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,306
He’s only two years younger than me!

103
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,683
I thought he was younger.
This might work out.

104
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,852
Once the show started,

105
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:39,190
Ren’s expression turned
exceedingly cool and mature.

106
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,443
I hear you’re getting ready
to release an album.

107
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,403
-More or less.
-When will it go on sale?

108
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,655
-Of course…
-Within the year.

109
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,908
he didn’t butt into my talk
with stupid remarks.

110
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,620
He’s gotten used to playing
the role of Trapnest’s Ren.

111
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,413
I don’t want him fooling around,

112
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,416
but something about this is
so stupid and annoying.

113
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,670
Now then, please take the stage!

114
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,921
The Black Stones!

115
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,804
I wanna smash it to pieces.

116
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,181
Something…

117
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,350
Everything…

118
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,729
Trapnest’s prim expressions…

119
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,524
Those smiles plastered on the MCs…

120
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,318
Their proper, polite questions
prepared ahead of time…

121
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:29,282
It’s all a monkey show!
It’s all a farce! Such a boring show!

122
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,243
But…

123
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,245
Even I…

124
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,539
I’m getting paid because I play
the role of BLAST’s Nana

125
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,791
that the media created.

126
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,836
This world isn’t so easy that
we can make a living

127
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,046
just doing whatever we want.

128
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:50,928
My life has always been a B movie.

129
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,140
Go ahead and play up my dark past.

130
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,225
Spread all the rumors you want.

131
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,980
But…

132
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:08,029
I have to be the one to write out…
a scenario for my bright future.

133
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:14,410
I’m no longer that helpless little girl
just standing there.

134
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,415
Marry me.

135
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,669
Marriage is such a formal concept.

136
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,714
It was never an issue between us before…

137
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,217
but if we wanna remain together

138
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,511
while protecting
each other’s present circumstances,

139
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,138
that may be our best option.

140
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,558
Marriage was probably
the best solution Ren came up with

141
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,268
after giving it considerable thought.

142
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,522
We’ll make an announcement to the public

143
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,192
that we really are in love,
and we'll get married to prove it.

144
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,404
I’m sure there will be some die-hard fans
who will go crazy with rage,

145
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:56,536
but most people will accept it
as a happy ending to a love story.

146
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,208
Everything has turned into a show now.

147
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,087
But I’m fine with that.

148
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:13,177
I can’t stand not seeing him
for an eternity.

149
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,471
And now for our final guests!

150
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,182
Appearing after a long absence,
here’s Trapnest!

151
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,101
Wow… Takumi!

152
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,478
I hear your new song

153
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,981
"Shadow of Love" was written
with a theme about trust, is that right?

154
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,234
-Yes.
-I’ve had the opportunity to listen to it.

155
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,487
Why are you always able to come up
with such beautiful lyrics?

156
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,488
Beautiful?

157
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,325
Trapnest’s music is so dignified,
but their lyrics are pretty banal.

158
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,579
When I listen to the music,
images come pouring out all at once.

159
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:43,791
And then words come raining down
to match the melody,

160
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,293
so writing the lyrics becomes
a natural process.

161
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,794
-Huh?
-That’s amazing!

162
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,796
I can't do it!

163
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,007
Well then, please stand by!

164
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,467
Aw, Takumi didn’t even talk.

165
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,386
I wanted to see
how he shows off when he talks.

166
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,304
How disappointing.

167
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:01,851
Until then, I was so taken
by Reira’s singing ability

168
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,021
that I never really paid attention
to her lyrics.

169
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,106
Since she talked
about her divine inspiration

170
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,232
with such a straight face,

171
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,775
I thought I’d pay attention to the lyrics.

172
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,068
OUR RED STRING. WE CAN'T SEE IT NOW.

173
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,821
It was just a song about an affair.

174
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:19,327
The suspicion about Takumi and Reira
grew stronger and stronger within me,

175
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,873
so after the show,
I tracked Ren down and asked him.

176
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,125
Nope. That’s just not possible.

177
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,835
How can you be so sure?

178
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:31,172
I dunno. But Takumi’s the type
who will always keep his word,

179
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,424
and he practically said it’s impossible.

180
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,009
I can’t trust that!

181
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,303
There’s nothing to worry about.

182
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,764
I’ve gotta get changed and head out now.

183
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,974
We’ll talk about that in length
some other time, okay?

184
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,267
When’s "some other time"?

185
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,650
I dunno.

186
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,985
Are you really serious
about getting married?

187
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,946
Huh? Then you’ll marry me?

188
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,831
I’ll discuss it with the agency.

189
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,001
You can’t just do whatever
you want either, right?

190
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:16,008
Why should we need the consent
of those around us

191
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,220
and a certificate for two people
to love each other?

192
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,182
Human society is such a pain.

193
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,938
RECREATION ROOM

194
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,440
The two bands in the tabloids
met face to face,

195
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,943
yet they didn’t touch
on the subject one bit.

196
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,152
How boring!

197
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,947
Of course not.
This isn’t one of those talk shows.

198
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,950
I wonder if the BLAST members
will be coming home late tonight.

199
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:41,909
Well, in particular, Nobu.

200
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,745
He did say this was all they had today.

201
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,124
Really? Then let’s invite them
and play some mahjong here!

202
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,501
-Mahjong?
-I hear they all love it!

203
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,837
They said so in a magazine interview.

204
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,547
I love mahjong!

205
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,464
Oh.

206
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,884
I don’t mind, but your ulterior motives
are showing through, Yuri.

207
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,347
I won’t lose to some sullen pervert
who casually records everything on video.

208
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,312
They’ll definitely be against it.

209
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,899
I said I’ll talk to the agency,
but the president is scary,

210
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,236
and I can’t compete against Ginpei
in either speech or strength.

211
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,322
Nana, once the contract money gets wired
to your account from Gaia,

212
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,949
go and buy yourself a cell phone.

213
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,993
You should at least send a text message
to Ren from time to time.

214
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,998
But if I talk this over with Yasu,
I know he’ll help me out.

215
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:33,002
I really can’t do a thing without Yasu.

216
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,255
Seriously, it’s inconvenient for work,
so buy one!

217
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,132
Why don’t you have one
in this day and age?

218
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,216
What’s the big fuss?

219
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,719
I’m sure it’ll just be hard on Ren

220
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,305
to wait for a message from her
that only comes once in a while.

221
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,682
When you own a cell phone,
you just get whipped around.

222
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:52,688
By whom? Hachi? Or that girl next door?

223
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:56,442
A social guy like you can’t hate
cell phones, too.

224
00:12:56,525 --> 00:13:00,654
I won’t bug you anymore, so please,
just find someone and be happy.

225
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,701
Nana didn’t appear to have
much energy tonight.

226
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,287
Really? She looked like she was beaming
with confidence to me.

227
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,706
But she looked spaced out
in the back row the whole time.

228
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,583
You’re really observant!

229
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:16,504
I was more concerned about Nobu,
who didn’t smile once.

230
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,839
Well, I guess if he’s performing
on the same stage as Takumi,

231
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,132
there’s not much to smile about.

232
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,761
I got an e-mail from Nobu the other day.

233
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,137
Huh? What did he say?

234
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,432
He wanted to properly talk
things over with me.

235
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,769
I broke up with Nobu
without saying anything.

236
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:35,481
But I don’t know how I should reply.

237
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,982
And it’s already been a month now.

238
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,985
So you never ended it properly with him.

239
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,154
I figured as much.

240
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,240
But you were right not to reply.

241
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,618
If you inadvertently give him any hope,
it would only make things worse for him.

242
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:51,497
But if he’s been ignored to that extent,
he’s probably given up and moved on.

243
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,209
But you know, Jun-chan,

244
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,254
to this day, whenever I remember Shoji,
it still hurts.

245
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,174
Why are we talking about Shoji
all of a sudden?

246
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:07,054
When I look back and think calmly
about when he started two-timing me

247
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:10,182
or what he was thinking at the time,

248
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:14,353
I realize I don’t know anything.

249
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,565
And what good would knowing do
at this point?

250
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,650
It’s not about what good it’ll do
or anything!

251
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,235
I think it’s because I remain in the dark

252
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:26,282
that even the fun times I had
with Shoji are now just painful memories!

253
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,536
I don’t know until what point it was real
and when it all became a lie.

254
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:35,082
It’s not easy to erase the shock
of being betrayed by someone you trusted.

255
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:40,963
So even if Nobu does date someone,

256
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,799
he may also be dragging around
painful memories like me.

257
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:48,304
And he’ll likely be seeing Takumi
from time to time.

258
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:54,310
I’m thinking
the only way I can make amends

259
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,688
is to properly talk to Nobu
and have him understand that,

260
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,816
although I chose Takumi,
I did truly love him.

261
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,903
But maybe that would only
make me feel better.

262
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,195
Would I be hurting him even more?

263
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,072
What do you think, Jun-chan?

264
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,993
That’s certainly a tough question.

265
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:15,748
I told her to do what she felt was right,
but I’m kind of worried.

266
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,918
Come to think of it,
Shoji did want to explain things to her.

267
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,588
-Maybe we shouldn’t have stopped him.
-Maybe not.

268
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,049
I know there isn’t any right answer
in these situations,

269
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:28,177
but I have a tendency to give out
advice like I know everything.

270
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,679
I felt responsible
and was kind of shocked.

271
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,641
From now on,
I’ll be careful not to interfere

272
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,684
in other peoples' business.

273
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,978
I don’t wanna turn
into some nosy old lady.

274
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,564
You really have been acting
like an old lady lately.

275
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,692
You’re acting like an old man,
and it’s rubbed off on me!

276
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,695
Kyosuke-Junko! You’re here.

277
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,322
Saying it together makes them sound
like some comedy duo!

278
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,449
Well, well, speak of the devil.

279
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,909
Were you trash-talking me again?

280
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,994
It’s unusual to see you coming
for a drink, Sachiko.

281
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,996
Mm-hmm! I just got paid,

282
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,040
so I thought why not splurge
every once in a while.

283
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,709
Shoji! You go off spending unnecessarily,

284
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,127
yet you’re making Sachiko
watch her spending?

285
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,922
You changed your hairstyle again
and to such a stylish color.

286
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,090
How much did it cost?

287
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:09,134
I took him to the stylist. I’m sorry.

288
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,638
Don’t mind what the nosy old lady says.

289
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,473
Oh, by the way,

290
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,017
did you know there’s a fireworks festival
tomorrow night at Tamagawa?

291
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,811
Huh? Fireworks in this season?

292
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,146
Remember? The one
they were planning in the summer

293
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,272
got canceled because of the typhoon.

294
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,190
Right.

295
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,192
There were so many requests
from the public to have it,

296
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,527
so they decided to do it after all.

297
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,736
Oh?

298
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,239
They’ll start the fireworks at 6:15 p.m.

299
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,116
If you’re free, what do you say the four
of us go see it together?

300
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,702
-Sorry, I have work.
-Me too.

301
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,954
That’s good. Then no one will be there
to get in our way.

302
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,414
But Nana seems to have
lots of time lately.

303
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,665
She might wanna go.

304
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,251
Don’t tell her!
What if we bump into each other?

305
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,128
How should I know?

306
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,005
Think for yourself.

307
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,382
NANA KOMATSU

308
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,510
Ron! Jun chan ryan pei kou.

309
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,679
JUN CHAN RYAN PEI KOU

310
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,682
No way! How come you’re so good?

311
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,058
Oh my!

312
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,810
Maybe because I trained for the role

313
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:04,064
as the mysterious, invincible woman
in the recent mahjong movie.

314
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,109
So you do stuff like that
to get into your role!

315
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,110
That’s awesome!

316
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,403
In my next video,

317
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,656
I star as the school nurse
at an all-boys high school.

318
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,533
Will you rehearse with me, Nobu?

319
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,826
Nurse uniform…

320
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,077
This is boring!

321
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,788
Hey, don’t pout
just because you can’t win.

322
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,291
-What are you, a kid?
-Go ahead, call me a kid.

323
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,459
Time for revenge, Yasu.

324
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,918
-Aren’t you gonna play, Nana?
-So about Yasu...

325
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,296
-I will later. I’m at a good part.
-Does Yasu always sleep in a yukata?

326
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,213
Does he starch it himself?

327
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,590
-I don’t know why,
-The more you know about Yasu,

328
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,258
-but Yuri’s practically giving Nobu
-the more he becomes a mystery.

329
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,427
-a free pass to do it with her,
-It's best not to try and figure him out.

330
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,095
so I’d better stay out of this.

331
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,097
I can’t butt in.

332
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,307
YURI KOSAKA PHOTO BOOK

333
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,352
HACHI - TOMORROW FROM 6:15 P.M.,
THEY’RE HAVING THE FIREWORKS FESTIVAL

334
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,353
AT TAMAGAWA THAT GOT CANCELED
LAST SUMMER BECAUSE OF THE TYPHOON.

335
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,397
Hey Nobu, don’t you have a girlfriend?

336
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,316
I had one, but she dumped me.

337
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,110
-Really? Then you must be lonely.
-Yes.

338
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,529
I’d sure like to comfort you.

339
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,947
POURING

340
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,116
I'm lonely too, Yuri.

341
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,618
What are you saying, baldy?

342
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,244
I’m joking.

343
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,455
-Well then, a threesome!
-No way!

344
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,706
No way!

345
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,711
Hey, Nobu.
Why are you talking like Hachiko?

346
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,964
Oh no… The beautiful Yuri
is starting to look like Hachi.

347
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,258
Even her hairstyle is kind of similar.

348
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,220
Hey, Yasu. Do you know what
our schedule is for tomorrow?

349
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,222
Ginpei was telling us
on our way back, remember?

350
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:21,100
In the morning,
we’re giving comments to be aired on TV.

351
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,936
In the afternoon,
there’s a photoshoot for posters.

352
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,395
At 6:00 p.m.,
we have a magazine interview,

353
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,898
and then at 10:00 p.m.,
we’ll be on a live radio show.

354
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:31,527
That sounds tough.
You should probably get to bed.

355
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,071
No, I won’t let you win and run.

356
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,031
I’ll exact Shin’s revenge.

357
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,534
Talk big all you want while you still can.

358
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,451
THEY’RE OUT OF CHARACTER

359
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,787
Can’t we cancel
that interview at 6:00 p.m.?

360
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,289
-What are you saying?
-Can’t we do it some other day?

361
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,457
Impossible!

362
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,837
But Hachi’s just invited us all
to the fireworks festival.

363
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,092
Who’s… this Hachi?

364
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:01,723
TOMORROW FROM 6:15 P.M.,
THEY’RE HAVING THE FIREWORKS FESTIVAL

365
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,850
AT TAMAGAWA THAT GOT CANCELED
LAST SUMMER BECAUSE OF THE TYPHOON.

366
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:03,976
THIS IS LIKE A DREAM.
I WAS THINKING HOW GREAT IT WOULD BE

367
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,185
IF WE COULD ALL GO TOGETHER.
BUT I GUESS I AM DREAMING TO THINK THAT.

368
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,647
Nobu!

369
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,485
You’ll go, right? Or rather, we’re going!

370
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,611
Nana, calm down.

371
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,947
You can’t! You’ve got work, right?

372
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,117
If it’s a magazine interview,
I’m sure they’ll reschedule if you ask.

373
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,328
But it doesn’t seem like such a good idea
for all of them to go out in public.

374
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,082
It’ll be fine if they disguise themselves.

375
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,543
-Shin! Hurry and text her back!
-What should I say?

376
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,462
Six o’clock in room 707.

377
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,423
I haven’t been home in nearly two months.

378
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,633
Those mosquitoes
would surely have left by now.

379
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,517
TOMORROW WE’LL BE WAITING
IN ROOM 707 AT 6:00 P.M.

380
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,019
WE’LL ALL BE THERE.
LET’S HOPE THE SKY’S CLEAR THIS TIME!

381
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,275
It’s not a dream, Hachi.

382
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:58,614
We can spend time and laugh together
like we did back then.

383
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,449
We can start over.

384
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,535
Please let me start over.

385
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,663
We’ll return to that summer day

386
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:10,959
and rewrite the scenario together
for our bright future!

387
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,966
-Hey, Takumi…
-Hm?

388
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,010
There’s something I wanna ask you.

389
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:21,637
What?

390
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,722
-Nana and I wanna--
-Shit!

391
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,766
The damn thing froze on me!

392
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,478
I’m tired.

393
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,729
Something’s coming out of you.

394
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,941
What did you want to ask me?
Does it have to be right now?

395
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:37,194
Actually, I think right now’s
not such a good time.

396
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,655
Oh, but I do have one question.

397
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,656
What?

398
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,283
That ring you bought for Hachiko.

399
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,993
Where did you get it,
and what kind was it?

400
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,871
Hey, Hachi.

401
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,290
Who could’ve imagined
in their wildest dreams

402
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,835
that the day would come when you and I,
with completely different tastes,

403
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,880
would each be wearing
a matching set of treasures?

404
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,968
I know you’re fickle and crave new things.

405
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,388
But I hope you still treasure it even now…

406
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:08,558
that generic-looking ring
from a high-end jewelry store.
