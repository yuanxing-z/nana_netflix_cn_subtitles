1
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,811
We kissed, held hands,

2
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:24,566
and walked to the convenience store
without saying a word.

3
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:54,929
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

4
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:18,263
His hand is so warm, just like Nana’s.

5
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:22,892
I don’t ever wanna let go of this hand.

6
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,903
What do I need to do to have him
understand this feeling?

7
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,866
I’m the girl who couldn't push Takumi away

8
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,951
even with Nobu there.

9
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:43,955
No matter what I say, I feel like he's not
gonna believe me at this point.

10
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,295
But the truth is, I’ve been holding back
the whole time.

11
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:55,717
I wanted to become Nobu’s girlfriend.
I wanted to touch him.

12
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,805
I had secretly been wishing

13
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,182
for the day
when he would hold me in his arms

14
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,768
as we’d walk this path along the river.

15
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:15,069
What expression do you have right now,
and what are you thinking?

16
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,822
I’m too scared to find out.

17
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,868
It’s okay if you wanna take me
away somewhere.

18
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,624
But what if he thinks
I could easily fall for a guy

19
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:31,920
even though I have a boyfriend,
and ends up seriously hating me?

20
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,098
What’s with all this boring talk, baldy?

21
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,853
We just have to sell records, right?

22
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,563
That’s no big deal at all.

23
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,025
Hurry up and tell Kawano
to have the contract ready.

24
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,570
-Got it? Answer me.
-Yes, ma'am.

25
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,573
Man, this is really making me sleepy.

26
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,325
I'm so sleepy, I could go bald.

27
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,493
I’m taking a bath and going to bed.

28
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:07,121
Huh? Aren’t you gonna stay up
until Hachiko returns?

29
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,666
She won’t be coming back. I win the bet.

30
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,003
I bet 100 yen that he’ll come
before they even do it!

31
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,005
But Ms. Hachiko has a boyfriend.

32
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,008
Well, if I can't stay at Nobu's place,

33
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,594
I guess I’ll just go back
to my parent's place tonight.

34
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,720
Your parent's place?

35
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:26,349
Oh, hello, Ryoko? Working hard?

36
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,768
I’m sorry for not contacting you
until now.

37
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,437
Yeah, I’m fine. I’m coming over now, okay?

38
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,402
Well, see ya, Misato.

39
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,696
Huh? You’re leaving? What about the wine?

40
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,947
Wait, Shin!

41
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,033
Who’s Ryoko?

42
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,410
She raised me.

43
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,538
Liar. I know you don't have a mother.

44
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,000
How do you know that?

45
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,294
If you don’t want people
finding out about you,

46
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,005
at least be smart enough to use an alias.

47
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,802
Lately, I haven’t told anyone
my full name.

48
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,804
Not that I care if people find out,

49
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:08,016
but I don’t like people snooping around.

50
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,728
Then don’t do things to make people worry.

51
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,189
You can put up a front as you like,
but you’re still a fifteen-year-old kid.

52
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,025
You’ll need a guardian
to sign on your behalf

53
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,694
on the record contract.

54
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,033
If you don’t wanna see him,
I’ll go and get that signature for you.

55
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,622
I’m counting on you, Yasu.

56
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,591
Misato, I’m going home, too.

57
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,550
Huh?

58
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,219
Sorry, I’ve got a lot of work to do.

59
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,597
That’s fine. I don’t mind, but…

60
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,892
Does that mean you’ve accepted defeat
in that bet you made?

61
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,478
Hachiko already has a boyfriend,
so are you all right with that?

62
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,605
Or rather, is Nobu all right with that?

63
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,065
I dunno.

64
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,359
Well, a man becomes weak
toward the woman he loves,

65
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:04,197
but I just can’t understand what goes on
in the complicated mind of a woman.

66
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,158
In other words,
it’s a complicated situation, isn't it?

67
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:11,037
I’m sorry. I’ll try to be more discreet.

68
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:18,086
You’ll be here until the end
of summer vacation, right, Misato?

69
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,962
Are your parents okay with that?

70
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,340
Yes. There’s no need to worry.

71
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,801
Can I ask you a personal question?

72
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,885
What is it?

73
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,347
Misato Uehara. What’s your real name?

74
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,393
It’s a secret.

75
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,858
It really was a fake name.

76
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,319
And she’s such a nice girl.

77
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:47,907
I really can’t understand women.
Man, oh man…

78
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,164
Huh?

79
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,504
Oh, there she is.

80
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,010
2001 FIREWORKS FESTIVAL
WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 22ND

81
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,637
TAMAGAWA RIVERBED
19:00 to 20:45

82
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,181
They’re having a fireworks festival!

83
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,182
It’s close by.

84
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,643
Wanna go together?

85
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,109
-I’ll carry one.
-It’s okay.

86
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,035
Actually, carry one.

87
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,424
-How can you tell?
-Huh? Tell what?

88
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,050
What I’m thinking.

89
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,052
I can’t tell.

90
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,804
I kind of feel a connection.

91
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,264
Really?

92
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,016
I have no clue what you’re getting at,

93
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,476
so if possible, can you explain it to me?

94
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,643
Telepathy?

95
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,853
Listen to what I’m saying.

96
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,107
Sorry, I have a tendency
to get carried away.

97
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:07,612
No, it’s ok. Actually I find
that dreamy side of you quite attractive.

98
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,031
Is he disappointed? What should I do?

99
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,575
Say, that method you use
where you seem interested

100
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,618
and then you pull back,

101
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,411
is that a trap to get a man
to fall for you?

102
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,329
No!

103
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,830
You seem carefree,
but you’re really cunning.

104
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,457
-You’re wrong!
-What a terrible woman.

105
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,541
Did the Demon Lord send you?

106
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,376
That’s why you talk passionately
about him like some missionary!

107
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,461
That’s not true!

108
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,214
You said so yourself,
that you’re a horrible woman…

109
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,718
I was joking. Don’t cry!

110
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:35,556
I’m sorry. I’ll break it off with Takumi.

111
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:42,605
I really didn’t want anyone to know
about what happened with Takumi.

112
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,107
I thought I could act
like nothing happened

113
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,568
and become your girlfriend.

114
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:53,115
I had such cunning thoughts. Lots of them.

115
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,118
Are you disappointed?

116
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,622
No. I’m happy.

117
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,711
Stop staring at me with those teary eyes.

118
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,797
I won’t be able to hold back.

119
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:15,972
I can't take you from him by force.

120
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,767
I can’t have you do something
that’ll make you a horrible woman.

121
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,272
If we let things get outta control now,

122
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,773
you’ll end up being trapped
between Takumi and me,

123
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,400
and you’ll suffer.

124
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,153
Because you’re kind and fragile.

125
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:38,327
I don’t find you cunning.
Don’t be so hard on yourself.

126
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,665
It can’t be helped that
you’re attracted to Takumi.

127
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,625
No matter how hard I try,

128
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,378
I’ll probably never be able
to compete with him.

129
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,963
That’s not true! I--

130
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:49,880
But if you

131
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:54,385
really do break it off with him
and be my woman…

132
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,097
I’ll do everything I can
to make you happy.

133
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:07,607
For the sake of your happiness,
I will do everything within my power.

134
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:13,029
Am I dreaming?

135
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:18,618
I mean, with you by my side,
I feel like I can do anything.

136
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:23,623
But it’s a dream that
I won’t wake up from.

137
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,126
When you break up with Takumi…

138
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:31,130
and sort out your feelings…
then come to me.

139
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,133
I’ll be waiting faithfully.

140
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,889
Hey, Nana,

141
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,268
I’ve fallen in love
many times to this day,

142
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,271
but I never imagined that
a man existed in real life

143
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,358
who would say those things and mean them.

144
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:55,821
What words has Ren given you so far?

145
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,325
I wanna talk to you, Nana.

146
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,629
Welcome back, Ms. Hachiko.

147
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,422
Sorry for getting back so late.

148
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,548
It’s okay.

149
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,966
Actually, you’re early.

150
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,010
Are you alone?

151
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,845
Huh? Where are Shin and Yasu?

152
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,222
Oh, they went home already.

153
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,725
What the heck?
And I bought all this for them!

154
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,813
I’m sorry.
Let’s save that for the next party.

155
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:29,939
By the way, where’s Nobu?

156
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,775
He walked me here,

157
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,444
but he said he was going home
because he has work tomorrow.

158
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,530
Is that so?

159
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,448
So something did happen?

160
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,700
Then I guess we can call it a day.

161
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,369
I’m working from the morning too.

162
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,954
Do you mind if I take a bath first?

163
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,997
Oh! Nana’s in there right now.

164
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,545
I figured you would barge in here.

165
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,630
You’ve gotta do something
about that peeping hobby of yours.

166
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,174
Nana.

167
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,348
Don’t get in!
What the hell are you thinking?

168
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,434
What’s the big deal? We’re both girls.

169
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,352
I’m not into taking baths
with other women!

170
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,728
So you would with a man?

171
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,605
-That’s normal.
-It’s usually the other way around.

172
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,899
Besides, it would be one thing
to share a bath with a human girl,

173
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,359
but this is a female dog that
just got back from a walk.

174
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,360
Wait, Nana.

175
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,612
Listen. It’s about Nobu.

176
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,161
What about Nobu?

177
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,384
He asked me to go see
the fireworks with him.

178
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,681
Then go.

179
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:49,852
Is he still in elementary school?
He’s useless! That man’s got no balls!

180
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,314
In any case, Yasu won the bet.
No wonder he's the leader.

181
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,357
He knows everything
about his band members.

182
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:01,697
I think I’ll wait until after I break up
with Takumi before I tell Nana.

183
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,575
She arranged for me to meet with Takumi

184
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,495
and cheered me on,
hoping the relationship would succeed.

185
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,331
I'm sure she'll be like, "What the hell?"

186
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,626
If I were in Nana’s shoes,
that’s what I would think.

187
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:17,880
Not only Nana. Everyone would think that.

188
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,568
I’ll say goodbye to him over the phone.

189
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,490
I don’t wanna see his face
when he gets hurt.

190
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,200
He's so full of pride.

191
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,207
Over the past few days,

192
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,833
some mosquitoes have taken
a liking to my place.

193
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:55,876
They’re so annoying.

194
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,921
Huh? Your place too, Takumi? Darn.

195
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,382
I was all excited because it was
like I was the only celebrity.

196
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,591
Nothing to be excited about!

197
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,052
Mosquitoes? It’s summer after all.

198
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,720
For real, Reira?

199
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,515
They’re at my place, too. The paparazzi.

200
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,642
I wonder whose blood they wanna suck.

201
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,770
Then they must be at my place, too.
This is bad.

202
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,021
It’s your blood they want.

203
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,314
Oh, that’s right.

204
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,108
You’ve got a woman staying
at your place, don’t you, Ren?

205
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,777
Make her go home before they find out.

206
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,737
We can't afford for you
to be in any scandals.

207
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,447
What’s wrong with that?

208
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,616
"Ren Honjo’s passionate
love life uncovered!"

209
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,536
It's not gonna hurt you, right?
In fact, it's adorable.

210
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,914
I’ll tell her to dress properly
whenever she goes out.

211
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,959
By the way,
when can we return to our homes

212
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,961
where the mosquitoes wait for us?

213
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,212
Then go home.

214
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,299
Our band will be
just fine without you, Naoki.

215
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,804
WE NEED TO TALK.

216
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,306
COULD YOU CALL ME WHEN YOU HAVE TIME?

217
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,682
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU AT A BUSY TIME.
NANA

218
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,684
INCOMING CALL

219
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,863
You didn’t have to respond so quickly.

220
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:08,991
Hello?

221
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,701
What did you wanna talk to me about?

222
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,999
What’s the matter? Did something happen?

223
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,210
The phone won’t do.

224
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,296
I can't say "goodbye" over the phone.

225
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,007
It’s inhumane.

226
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,927
Can we meet now and talk?

227
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,013
Sorry. We’re filming a TV show right now.

228
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,515
Oh, is that so?
Sorry to bother you during work.

229
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,852
It’s okay. We spend more time
waiting than shooting.

230
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,020
It’s such a drag.

231
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,813
That’s rare for you to be on TV.

232
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:43,025
Satellite TV.
They’re doing a special on us.

233
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,527
Really? But we don't have a tuner at home.

234
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,613
If you’re a fan, then buy one.

235
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,739
This isn’t good.

236
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,283
This is no time to be chatting casually.

237
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,996
Is it something you
can’t discuss over the phone?

238
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:00,834
I’m fully booked for a while,
and I can’t make any plans.

239
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,044
I see…

240
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,880
What? Don’t tell me you’re pregnant!

241
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,382
Huh? No, that’s not it!

242
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:12,304
So that’s not it. Thank goodness.
You scared me there.

243
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,723
I may not look it,
but I’m pretty sensitive.

244
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,601
I don't deal well
with inconveniences like that.

245
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,645
Sorry.

246
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,314
Inconvenience?

247
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,857
Who talks like that?

248
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,151
Tossing aside his responsibilities
like it’s the normal thing to do!

249
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,529
There’s something wrong with him
as a human being!

250
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,155
And why am I apologizing?

251
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,282
We’re up.

252
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,286
Sorry, I’ll have to go now.

253
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,122
I’ll call you when I have some time.

254
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,916
You don’t have to!
In fact, don’t ever call me again!

255
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:42,918
Goodbye!

256
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,548
I told him. I was able to tell him!

257
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,305
It’s over.

258
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,937
Nana seems pissed off with me.

259
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,063
Huh? Nana?

260
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,358
Oh, you mean Hachiko.
I can see why she’s pissed off.

261
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,860
"Don’t tell me you’re pregnant!"

262
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,737
"You scared me there. An inconvenience."

263
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,488
And you say you're sensitive?

264
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,115
You don't even have
an ounce of sensitivity.

265
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,994
But it would really be a problem,
so I had to tell her.

266
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,038
Besides, she’d be the one
most troubled by it.

267
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,539
If you think so,

268
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,125
then I suggest you come up
with a proper and bright family plan.

269
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,294
You’re one to talk.

270
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,795
It’s not a problem with me.

271
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,881
In fact, I would love to start
a bright family.

272
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:32,342
But she’s on the pill again.
Such a dark woman.

273
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,345
So it’s all about what you want.

274
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,852
He’s not calling back.

275
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,981
How come? That’s so anti-climactic.

276
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:52,780
Why was I clinging
onto such a loveless man?

277
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,740
It's like a one-hundred-year romance

278
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,116
just came to an abrupt end.

279
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,494
Wait a minute.

280
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,623
I knew from the start that
Takumi had no love in him.

281
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:07,586
There’s no way Takumi
would be hurt by what I say.

282
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:11,256
I’ve awakened
from a hundred-year sleep. That’s all.

283
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,133
Every time we meet,

284
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:17,137
we get under the covers,
and he tells me sweet nothings.

285
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,889
Whenever we held each other tight,

286
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:22,726
I vaguely had this vision that a day
would come when this will turn to love.

287
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:28,065
Still that was nothing but an illusion.

288
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,484
I have finally awakened to the truth.

289
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,986
I’ll be waiting faithfully.

290
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:38,992
The kiss of a real prince has awakened me.

291
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,292
PRINCE

292
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,754
Although he doesn’t really strike me
as the prince type.

293
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,297
But never mind that.

294
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,716
You surprised me!

295
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,303
Sorry to bother you at work.
Nana told me where you work.

296
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,557
So you work in a record store.

297
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,518
Come to think of it, you’ve got
a lot of records at your place, too.

298
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,104
Actually, I only work here twice a week.

299
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,730
Other days, I have short-term jobs
and do other stuff.

300
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,984
I see. By the way,
what time do you get off today?

301
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:12,901
At nine.

302
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,487
Then I’ll wait for you
at the café next door.

303
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,738
Oh?

304
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,783
Come to think of it,

305
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,745
there are many things that
I don't know about Nobu yet.

306
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,957
I want to learn everything about him.

307
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,835
But I’ll bet his blood type is A…

308
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,920
since he seems to be the serious type.

309
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,760
Darn it. I’m feeling restless.

310
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,765
-Hi there!
-Stop startling me!

311
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,438
Hey Nobu, are you hungry?

312
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,566
I came directly after work,
so I haven’t eaten anything either.

313
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,568
Oh? Then let’s have dinner somewhere.

314
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,237
Actually, I wanna go to your place
and make something!

315
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,780
Huh? My place?

316
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,782
-No good!
-Why not?

317
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,159
I told you yesterday.

318
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,869
Put an end to things first,
and then come to me.

319
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,871
But I did. That’s why I came.

320
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:06,788
Too fast!

321
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,834
I’m sorry.
But I was holding back all day today.

322
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,545
The day seemed like a year to me.

323
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:17,674
It might’ve felt like a year to you,
but one day is still one day.

324
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,801
Then I’ll try and wait for one more day.

325
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,972
-Can you cook meat and potato stew?
-It’s my specialty!

326
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:28,310
She’s so cute! Let’s just pretend
that a year has passed.

327
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,812
Where’s Hachiko?

328
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,606
She said she may not be coming home today.

329
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,066
I got an email from her.

330
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,068
You think she’s
at her boyfriend’s place again?

331
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,112
What? But I thought
they’re filming until midnight.

332
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,909
TELL ME WHERE NOBU WORKS! HACHIKO

333
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,913
Hey, Nana…

334
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,959
What words of love has Ren given you?

335
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:59,091
I should’ve asked you then.
I should've asked…

336
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:05,931
That claw-foot bathtub…
isn't here anymore.
