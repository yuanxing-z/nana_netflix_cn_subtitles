00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:09,217
I realized that the time had come to face
the problem I had been ignoring

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:14,889
by not thinking too deeply about it.

Why does being pregnant make me
so sleepy every day?

SEPTEMBER 24TH
NOBU - HOW ARE YOU?

00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:41,828
RECEIVED MAIL
SEPTEMBER 24TH 2:36 A.M.

00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,912
NOBU
HOW ARE YOU?

10
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,332
HOW ARE YOU?

11
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,209
I WANT TO HAVE A PROPER TALK
WITH YOU. IS IT POSSIBLE?

12
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,419
I’LL BE WAITING FOR YOUR REPLY.

13
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,014
NO NEW MESSAGES

14
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,516
Nobu!

15
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,394
Yasu says lunch is ready.

16
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,897
Spaghetti with mushrooms!

17
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:14,193
I think we can count on a tasty meal.
Yasu’s cooking is the best.

18
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,904
Who are you expecting a reply from?

19
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,824
You’ve been checking
your email all morning.

20
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,951
Well, you know,
because the reception is bad here.

21
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,996
But you usually leave your cell phone
in your room.

22
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:31,461
Shin, do something about that habit
of yours of closely observing others.

23
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:36,007
Sorry. But you’re easy to figure out
even without observing closely.

24
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,550
I don’t want you figuring me out!

25
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,802
But I can.

26
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,889
It’s dangerous here.

27
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:46,601
Looking at the night sky,
it’s as if you can reach the stars.

28
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,562
You get the feeling that
your dreams will come true.

29
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,526
Shin, thank you for your email.

30
00:03:56,194 --> 00:04:01,157
I feel it’s been a long time
since I’ve seen that many stars.

31
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,327
Even if I close my eyes,

32
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,873
I can only imagine artificial neon lights
like in a planetarium.

33
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:14,045
Because I thought I’m no different
from such neon lights.

34
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:18,299
Your words have saved me once again, Shin.

35
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,551
Thank you so much.

36
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,893
PHEW

37
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,980
Thank you, Nami. You have quite the tan.

38
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,857
No! Yes! I mean,
I’m sorry, I’m kind of nervous!

39
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,777
I’ve been a big fan of Trapnest
since your debut!

40
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,861
Really?

41
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,406
Don’t question her. She’s being polite.

42
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,283
Honey!

43
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,743
You think this pattern is too flashy?

44
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,912
You don’t need to wear a tie.

45
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,082
I have to look dignified as a father.

46
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,626
Sorry to keep you waiting!

47
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,799
Pleased to meet you. I’m Takumi Ichinose.

48
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,676
You sure are tall! H-- How tall are you?

49
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,178
One meter and 83 centimeters, right?

50
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:08,182
I wasn’t asking you. Fawning all over him…

51
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:12,437
I apologize that it took so long
before I could come.

52
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,314
These are some gifts from England.

53
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,525
Though, the only thing British
about them is the tea.

54
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,485
-Oh my, this much?
-What is it?

55
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,989
Wow, thanks, Brother!
I’ll follow you for the rest of my life!

56
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,324
How cozy!

57
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:28,745
It’s beautiful! Your father
would never buy me things like this.

58
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,706
You certainly seem to be well-off,
Mr. Ichinose.

59
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:35,585
Do celebrities get paid that well?

60
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,128
It depends on the person.

61
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,338
After all, your profits are determined
by your popularity.

62
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,423
That’s true.

63
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,051
Are you sure you can provide
for my daughter and her child

64
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,094
for the rest of their lives?

65
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,346
-I’m positive, sir.
-"Sir "?

66
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,724
He seems like an untrustworthy guy.

67
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:54,270
I may be a celebrity on the outside,
but I’m just a hard worker.

68
00:05:54,896 --> 00:06:00,109
It’s difficult to continue a band
regardless of its popularity.

69
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,196
I’d like to be in the same band forever,

70
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,531
but that’s not something that
I alone can determine.

71
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:14,415
Today, I wore a wedding dress
while filming our promo video.

72
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,667
It’s a song about a woman
who can’t get married.

73
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,462
The staff just don't get it!

74
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:25,593
We filmed the entire day for a few scenes
that will only be a few seconds.

75
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,637
Everything we work on is like that.

76
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,515
The work takes a lot of effort,

77
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,852
but the thrill of completing something
together is like none other,

78
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:39,232
and with my friends,
I’m able to feel that I belong here.

79
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,651
Thinking back, that’s probably
why I was able to come this far

80
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,445
with my singing
no matter how tough things got.

81
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,156
All right, okay. We’re done.

82
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,118
-Done already?
-We’ve done enough.

83
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,828
At your current level as a singer,

84
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,913
it’ll be the same, no matter
how many times we record.

85
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:57,500
In other words, you’ve given it
all you’ve got for now, and it was great.

86
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,876
What’s that supposed to mean?

87
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:03,089
We can artificially adjust the high notes
you have trouble reaching.

88
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,674
Do some voice training
before the live performance,

89
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,883
so you don’t embarrass yourself.

90
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,428
Otherwise, the music magazines
will start writing nasty things about you.

91
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,889
Shut up! Stop laughing!
Let me sing it again!

92
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,685
Well then, now that we’re done
with the recording,

93
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,978
what do you say we go fishing?

94
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,021
-Yeah, that sounds like fun.
-All right!

95
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,524
That’s the only thing I’ve been looking
forward to doing here.

96
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,276
-The only thing?
-Matsuo!

97
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,153
Let me sing some more!

98
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,447
Keep it down!
You’ll scare off all the fish!

99
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,198
Say, why did your wife leave you?

100
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,450
Um…

101
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:34,871
I think the number one reason Gaia
decided to record at that training camp

102
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:39,125
was to strengthen the bond
between the band members and the staff.

103
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,837
The staff you’ll be working
with from now on

104
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,008
will be like your family,
there to support the band.

105
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:51,429
I think participating in that camp
has great meaning to it.

106
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,682
Let’s both do our best.

107
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,727
Mr. Ichinose, what about your family?

108
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,895
How many siblings do you have?

109
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,897
You have a big sister, right?

110
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,815
We’re not asking you.

111
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,900
Honey…

112
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,986
Would you let me talk too?
This isn’t any fun!

113
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,114
But you hardly know a damn thing
about my family, don't you?

114
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,283
-"A damn thing"?
-Excuse my language.

115
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,534
Oh, that’s not a problem at all!

116
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,870
You can use that language with me
whenever you damn please!

117
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,539
It’s not fine! Not at all!
And your Japanese is funny!

118
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,417
Nami, go buy some sake.

119
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,335
Yes, you do that.

120
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,920
And pick up the ingredients
for sukiyaki too.

121
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,756
Huh? No way!
Besides, what are the ingredients? Meat?

122
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,966
Let’s take the car
and go together, Nami. Okay?

123
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,052
You wanna go out
with your new handbag, don’t you?

124
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:35,765
Don’t tell me you like Nami.
Please, anyone but her.

125
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:40,061
I’m so sorry! Nana and Nami
are both such noisy girls.

126
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,897
Me too? Don’t group me with Nami!

127
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,524
Not at all. I’m enjoying this very much.

128
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,901
My mother was very weak,

129
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,237
and the rest of my family
was rather gloomy.

130
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,238
Perhaps because of that,

131
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,282
I’ve always been drawn
to energetic, happy people.

132
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,161
That’s why I find this so attractive.

133
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:02,375
The feeling of a loving family
like yours. This is fun.

134
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,795
I see.

135
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,257
Well, one thing I can guarantee
is Nana’s good health.

136
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,300
So how is your family doing now?

137
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,095
My mother passed away six years ago.

138
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,430
My sister married a local man.

139
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,183
They now live
with their two children and our father.

140
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:23,854
Okay, then we should give them
a visit sometime soon.

141
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,315
We’ll all go and pay our respects
at your mother’s grave.

142
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,484
-Yes, we should.
-No, it’s okay.

143
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,402
-Huh?
-Huh?

144
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,613
In fact, my father is
a complete alcoholic,

145
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,409
and lately, he can’t even manage
a proper conversation. I’m sorry.

146
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,078
An alcoholic. That must be tough for you.

147
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,622
But we still should go
and introduce ourselves.

148
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,416
No, it’s really all right.

149
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,002
He’s the type of man
that wouldn’t even attend

150
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,754
my sister’s wedding
or my mother’s funeral.

151
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,507
Besides, I have no intention
of inviting him to our wedding.

152
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,134
I wouldn’t want him ruining it.

153
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,637
If there’s something not right
about the father,

154
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,098
the child isn’t going to amount to much.

155
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,600
I’m a good example.

156
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,104
More importantly, about the location
of the wedding ceremony,

157
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,064
would you mind taking a look
at these documents?

158
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,483
Hey, guy. You’re not a salesman.

159
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,777
Honey! Don't call him "guy"!

160
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:40,723
Ren?

161
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,638
Ren, you’ll catch a cold
if you sleep here.

162
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,231
Here. Come here like a good boy.

163
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,859
Come on.

164
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:39,782
Reira? I’m sorry. I guess I dozed off.

165
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,952
Did Mr. Honjo have a bit
too much to drink?

166
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,245
Is he okay?

167
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,666
Yeah. This always happens.

168
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,587
-Help me carry him to the bed.
-Sure.

169
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,008
Shin.

170
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:04,014
Right now, I’m really
regretting having left in Japan

171
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,892
the lighter you purposely forgot.

172
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:11,605
I left it because I didn’t want
to risk losing or breaking it,

173
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:15,609
but I feel uneasy not having it
within reach.

174
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,238
Taking care of something is so difficult.

175
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:25,077
I’ll be returning to Japan on the 27th.

176
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,956
When will you be returning to Tokyo, Shin?

177
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,543
I wanna talk with you face to face.

178
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,338
Because I believe looking
someone in the eye

179
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,425
without any pretenses is
like looking at yourself.

180
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,345
If you look away, you lose.

181
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,600
And I don’t wanna lose.

182
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,149
FROM REN
MESSAGE FOR NANA

183
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,859
I GOT BACK TO JAPAN TODAY.
PLEASE GIVE ME A CALL.

184
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,861
-Did you read it?
-Yeah.

185
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,613
THE HOUSEWIFE NEXT DOOR
BY AI YAZAWA

186
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,698
Without delay,
the eight-day, seven-night-long recording

187
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,909
at the training camp finally
came to an end.

188
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,078
But even after returning to Tokyo,

189
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:12,082
I can’t go home while the place
is still infested with those mosquitoes.

190
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:16,003
What are you reading, Shin?
You’re into literature, I see.

191
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:19,381
An erotic novel. Mika bought it
for me at a book stand.

192
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,342
Is it any good, Shin?

193
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,427
-Not at all.
-Huh?

194
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,845
-No use trying to tease him, Mika.
-Oh, Mika.

195
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,305
-I think Shin knows more about that
-You can only touch him

196
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,515
-than you do.
-from the neck up.

197
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,557
Huh?

198
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,769
-But this is good study material.
-What study is that?

199
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:32,686
THE HOUSEWIFE NEXT DOOR
BY AI YAZAWA

200
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,146
The Housewife Next Door?

201
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,273
Starting today,

202
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,109
we’re all being thrown
into the agency’s so-called dormitory.

203
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,321
They just call it a dormitory.

204
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,032
It’s really a regular apartment building.

205
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,951
It’s for our agency’s talents only,
though.

206
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,787
Everyone gets their own room,
there’s no curfew,

207
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,705
and there's no nosy dorm supervisor.

208
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,750
But the security and facilities are
above the basic standards,

209
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,918
so it’s safe and comfortable!

210
00:13:56,585 --> 00:14:01,257
I don’t care what it is,
as long as I can relax and get some sleep.

211
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,930
You’re better off not opening the window.

212
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,474
That’s a love hotel next door.

213
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,561
They’re not likely to open
their windows too often either.

214
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,065
What’s comfortable about this?
I don’t get any sunlight here!

215
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,150
You have your own toilet and shower.

216
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,277
Where’s the bathtub?

217
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,446
You’re such a complainer!
Who do you think you are?

218
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,493
If you wanna live the high life,
then work your way up there.

219
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,413
I’ll make certain that you have
a full schedule starting tomorrow.

220
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,834
Wait, Ginpei! Is there a phone here?

221
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,460
There’s one on the first floor
at the front desk!

222
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,378
The front desk?

223
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,339
At least buy a cell phone!
Work will be so inconvenient without one!

224
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,966
That’s not a front desk!

225
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,346
And the security guard’s asleep!
What’s the point of having one?

226
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,473
He’s bored,
which is proof of how safe it is.

227
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,393
I’ll pick you up
tomorrow morning at 7:00 a.m.

228
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:57,229
Don’t go wandering off outside!

229
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,315
There’s something wrong.

230
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,609
Something’s definitely wrong
about this production company.

231
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,570
Even the president was a weirdo.

232
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,572
Well, do your best.

233
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:11,160
No, I can’t judge people
by their appearances,

234
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,996
but this guy also looks like one of them.

235
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,082
-Who are you, miss?
-I’m Nana from the Black Stones!

236
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,375
I just introduced myself
to you moments ago!

237
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,295
Oh right. Did you want something?

238
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,504
I wanna use the phone.

239
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,882
Go ahead and use it. It’s free.

240
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:28,385
NO LONG PHONE CALLS

241
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,472
Forget it. I don’t wanna be overheard.

242
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,057
I’ll borrow Nobu’s phone.

243
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,017
Really, go ahead and use it, miss!

244
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:42,983
But say I call Ren,
what am I gonna say to him?

245
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,655
We’re not gonna be able to see
each other for a while anyway.

246
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,198
I actually would prefer
that he leave me alone

247
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,951
rather than have him half-heartedly
show some affection toward me.

248
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,912
That’s what I should say to him.

249
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:05,506
I’m finding it hard to breathe.
It must be because the air is dirty.

250
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,177
That’s why I hate Tokyo.

251
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,557
Huh? The Black Stones? I know the band!

252
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,185
-You do?
-Well, it’s famous, in a way!

253
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,770
No, not nearly as famous as you.

254
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,189
This is so exciting! Hey, come on in!

255
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,565
Huh? But…

256
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,984
Come on! Hurry!

257
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,860
Ow!

258
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,030
What are you doing, little man?
You seem to be having fun.

259
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,657
Well, I was just saying hi to my neighbor.

260
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,616
Nana?

261
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,620
She’s gorgeous! She sure is a celebrity!

262
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,956
It’s the real Nana!
Please give me your autograph!

263
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,792
-Huh? Yuri Kosaka?
-That adult film star?

264
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,794
You all seem to know her.

265
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,963
RESIDENTS RULE BOOK

266
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,550
What the hell kind of agency is
"Shikai Corporation"?

267
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,719
Why are there adult film actresses
working for the agency?

268
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,805
Well, she did start out as an idol.

269
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,473
But when her popularity dipped,
she took her clothes off.

270
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,767
You know a lot about her, Yasu.

271
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:03,147
And how could you make the dormitory coed?

272
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,690
That’s borderline outrageous!

273
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,359
I’m guessing it’s to accommodate
or shelter their talents

274
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,986
with some sort of problems.

275
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,156
Like Ginpei was saying,
they just call it a dormitory.

276
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,659
You’re right. But Ms. Yuri’s been
in so many adult films,

277
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,244
so she must have money.

278
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,329
So why is she living
in a shabby place like this?

279
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,539
Ms. Yuri?

280
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,751
-Nobu! Switch rooms with me.
-Huh?

281
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,627
With a starving wolf like
you living next door,

282
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,795
"Ms. Yuri" would be in danger!

283
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,798
-I’m not gonna do anything! She’s a pro!
-I don’t care! Just switch!

284
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,844
Why are you always so bossy?

285
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:37,890
Nobu, I couldn’t care less
if you get off on porn videos,

286
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,602
but I hope you haven’t forgotten our plan.

287
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,145
Plan?

288
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:48,776
To get Hachiko back!
We pledged to fight together!

289
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,277
So don’t get involved with other women!

290
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,405
What are you saying?
You’re misunderstanding.

291
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,782
Misunderstanding?

292
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,702
You were bashfully
and gleefully chatting with Yuri!

293
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,496
No, not that.

294
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,251
I’m not necessarily fighting
to get Hachi back.

295
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,796
And this is unrelated to that.

296
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,048
For me, Hachi and the band
are separate issues.

297
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,221
Besides, why do I have
to take care of Hachi

298
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,223
just so you can own her in your yard?

299
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,725
Honestly speaking,
I have completely given up on her,

300
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,352
so do whatever you wish on your own.

301
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:29,233
-But…
-What? Damn, you’re being stubborn.

302
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,737
Then what are we fighting for?

303
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,072
Huh?

304
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,994
That’s a stupid question.

305
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,289
We’re fighting

306
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:49,586
so our music will be accepted
as professional.

307
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,338
Hachi has nothing to do with it.

308
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,256
Nana?

309
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:57,261
Nobu is free to date whomever he wants.

310
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:03,725
But then,
how do I stay connected to Hachi?

311
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,020
I can no longer go home to that place,

312
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:11,275
and even if I did,
Hachi’s no longer there.

313
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,777
Hey, Yasu, how do you read this kanji?

314
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,156
"Itsuwari." It means "lie."

315
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,574
Thanks.

316
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,535
NOBU

317
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,870
Yes?

318
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,913
Yasu! Nana’s…

319
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,208
Nana!

320
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,885
Shin, call an ambulance! The number’s 119.

321
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,386
What’s the address here?

322
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,680
Tell Mr. Yamagishi, the security guard,
and have him call one!

323
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,639
Okay!

324
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,521
We were talking, and then all of a sudden,

325
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,523
she was short of breath
and seemed to be in pain,

326
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,150
like she was having an attack.

327
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:02,367
Nana, are you okay?
An ambulance will be here soon.

328
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:08,165
It’s okay. Don’t worry.
I won’t leave your side.

329
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,376
I’m not going anywhere.

330
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,682
I think she’s hyperventilating.

331
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,437
It’s so painful you think you’re dying,

332
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,439
but you will never die from it.

333
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,690
What?

334
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,318
It’s a living hell.

335
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,653
Hey, wait!

336
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,155
Nobu! Do you have a paper or plastic bag?

337
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,406
Huh? Why?

338
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,867
Just hurry and find one!

339
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,704
Hey, Hachi.

340
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,875
Humans are such pathetic creatures.

341
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,294
The harder they struggle,
the deeper they sink.

342
00:20:55,671 --> 00:21:00,133
If I were to be born again,
