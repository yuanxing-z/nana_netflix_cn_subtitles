1
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:05,296
The contract money Gaia transferred
into our accounts,

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,383
the expected monthly salaries
from the agency,

3
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:11,594
and estimated royalties
we’ll be receiving from CD sales…

4
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:15,807
Our band is no longer
some humble amateur band.

5
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:22,230
I figured I could easily support
Hachi and her baby now.

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,463
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

7
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:33,319
We played mahjong till dawn
in the recreation room

8
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,489
on the second floor…

9
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,699
Ron.

10
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,742
And we took Yuri to her room since

11
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,287
-she could no longer walk on her own.
-I’m all right. I’m all right.

12
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,372
-Don’t you touch her!
-Right.

13
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,625
Good night! Let’s do this again soon!

14
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,628
After listening closely to confirm that
she was retiring to bed,

15
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,755
I got into bed myself.

16
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,801
Even if it were casual,
if they end up doing it,

17
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,761
Nobu would get emotionally involved.

18
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,889
That’s the kind of guy Nobu is.

19
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:05,935
Right now, I want him
to think only of Hachi.

20
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,898
I still want him to love only Hachi.

21
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,485
But I wanna stop saying
such selfish things.

22
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,531
God… Buddha… Demon Lord…

23
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:23,494
Please make Nobu and Hachiko
get back together.

24
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,677
It’s past eight o'clock.
You’d better get up, or you’ll be late.

25
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,305
Sure… Huh? What about my alarm?

26
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,890
-It went off.
-Sorry!

27
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,726
Do you find it noisy every morning?
Or do you find me noisy?

28
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:51,731
Yeah. Thanks to you, I’ve been
able to sleep really well lately.

29
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,610
-Was she being sarcastic?
-Maybe.

30
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,487
You’re alone on the fourth floor,
aren’t you?

31
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,864
You’re not planning to move here, are you?

32
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:05,286
Think why I fled from Room 603
after just one night.

33
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,747
Then what about the third floor?
Does anyone live there?

34
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,831
I’ve never seen anyone from there.

35
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,542
More importantly,
what are you gonna do today, Nobu?

36
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,003
Are you going to the fireworks festival?

37
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,925
-Yeah.
-You’re gonna get Hachi back!

38
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,803
-Huh? Well…
-You coward.

39
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:24,973
Hey! That’s something
I should decide after I see her!

40
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,018
If she seems happy,
then that’s good enough for me.

41
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:30,979
I don’t wanna get her back

42
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,814
if it’s gonna interfere
with her happiness.

43
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:38,403
But… if she seems sad,
then I couldn’t leave her like that.

44
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,660
No!

45
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,453
You seriously think
you can just cancel your interview

46
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,372
at the last minute for personal reasons?

47
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,334
I never said anything about canceling it!

48
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,503
I’m just asking you to move it
to another day!

49
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,587
Absolutely not!

50
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,006
Besides, I can’t let you loose
in a big crowd like that.

51
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,174
Don’t worry about that.

52
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,845
Mika and Masaru said they’d help,
so our disguises will be perfect.

53
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:07,056
Oh my! You think you can get away using

54
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,891
a professional hair stylist and
makeup artist for your personal business?

55
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,144
But when we called and asked,

56
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,646
they both found it amusing
and were looking forward to it.

57
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,065
I wonder what kind of interesting outfits
they have planned for us.

58
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,817
Regardless, I won’t allow it!

59
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,737
All right.

60
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,449
If you won’t allow it,
I’ll just have to skip work.

61
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,659
What did you say?

62
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,703
I’m so disappointed in you, Nana.

63
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,372
You’ve got a bad attitude,
and you’re a lousy singer,

64
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,624
but at least I valued you
for your enthusiasm toward your work.

65
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,792
I’m lousy?

66
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,544
Well, that’s why, Ginpei,

67
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,464
I wish you’d understand that
for Nana to be insisting so much,

68
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:42,633
this has gotta be something
really important to her.

69
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,472
Yasu… I understand.

70
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,141
For you to say so, it’s gotta be something
really important.

71
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,267
What the hell?

72
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,436
I’ll discuss it with the reporter.

73
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,439
He’s really in love with him?

74
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,607
Oh, sure, that’s fine.

75
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,317
We still have time
before the proofing deadline.

76
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,319
Monday? Not a problem at all.

77
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,572
Then I’ll try to finish this game
and return to work before then.

78
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,368
What’d he say?

79
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,829
He was extremely troubled by it

80
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,831
but has agreed to somehow adjust
his schedule to accommodate us.

81
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:14,957
All right!

82
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,209
I’m sorry for the trouble, Ginpei.

83
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,127
-It’s okay.
-This is great! Isn’t it, Nobu?

84
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,921
I do have a heart, you know.

85
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,173
-That’s good news, isn’t it, Nana?
-Hey, come on! Aren’t you happy?

86
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,216
Y-- Yeah…

87
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:28,179
Our band is becoming
more and more like a family.

88
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,931
You can’t smoke!

89
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,766
-Ginpei’s like the strong mama,
-Why just me?

90
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,018
-Yasu’s the dependable oldest son,
-If you quit, Shin might quit too.

91
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:39,148
Nobu’s the kind-hearted second son,
and Shin’s the bratty baby of the family.

92
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,526
It’s because I’m protected by this family

93
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,320
that I can get away with being
so selfish and spoiled.

94
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,697
But then who’s the dad?

95
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:50,118
If it’s the president, that would make
us some gangster family.

96
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,035
BLACK STONES CLAN

97
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:55,414
I guess I’ll settle on the raccoon guy.
At least he’s better than the fox guy.

98
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,917
That’s not bad.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,506
I’ve always wanted to be part
of a big family like the ones on TV.

100
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:08,886
Now if Hachi would marry Nobu,
it would be perfect.

101
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,346
OBSTETRICS GYNECOLOGY
NAKAZATO CLINIC

102
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,849
You’re now fourteen weeks along.

103
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,643
The baby is growing well.

104
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,771
I’ve got a pretty good idea
ò the gender of the baby.

105
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,897
Huh?

106
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,942
Would you like to know now?

107
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,779
Or would you like to keep it a surprise
for when the baby’s born?

108
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,533
I do want to know,

109
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,535
but perhaps it would be
more exciting to wait?

110
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,120
What should I do…

111
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,582
It’s still an educated guess
at this point.

112
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,499
Yes.

113
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,211
It’s good that your morning sickness
subsided fairly quickly,

114
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,214
but I am concerned
about your rapid weight gain.

115
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,718
If you gain too much,
it can be dangerous in many ways,

116
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,263
so try to focus on eating proper portions
of nutritionally balanced foods, okay?

117
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,309
Actually, appearance wise,

118
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,561
I don’t wanna gain weight either.

119
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,937
I ate too much at lunch.

120
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,190
I’ll avoid the food stands
at the fireworks festival.

121
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,324
Did you say something, Sachiko?
Huh? You want a Jackson Burger?

122
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,410
No, no. I have a bad feeling
about that place.

123
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,539
Maybe I shouldn’t go
to the fireworks festival after all.

124
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,125
Well, I’m sure it’ll be really crowded,

125
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,711
so your chances of seeing her are minimal.

126
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,755
But what if I run into her?

127
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,925
Myself aside, I’d feel bad for Sachiko.

128
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,344
Her evening of fun would be ruined.

129
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:35,890
I think it’d be worse not to take her
for those reasons.

130
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,975
That’s why I’m in a bind!

131
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,102
-Damn you, Junko!
-Welcome!

132
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,105
It’s been so long, Koichi Sato!

133
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,234
Nana…

134
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:50,655
My bad feelings have come true.
I’ve been led here by the Demon Lord.

135
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,782
If you had a revelation, then don’t come!

136
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,618
But Sachiko said she was hungry.

137
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,329
A Jackson Burger and fresh orange juice.

138
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,081
Sure.

139
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:00,998
Sachiko?

140
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,876
The baby in my tummy. Four months now.

141
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,586
Why’d you name it that?

142
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,629
-You’re scaring me!
-Don’t ask me!

143
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,464
I didn’t wanna name her that either!

144
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,632
Then don’t!

145
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:13,386
But my husband has
his heart set on Sachiko.

146
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,097
By "husband," you mean Takumi of Trapnest?

147
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,309
-Jun-chan, you blabbermouth!
-So it is!

148
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,561
Huh?

149
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,355
No, it’s okay. I won’t tell anyone.

150
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,856
I swear to the Demon Lord himself.

151
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,651
Sure, I promise. I promise, so…

152
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,696
-Can I get Reira’s autograph?
-You were a fan?

153
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,365
I thought I’d display it
in the alcove at my parents’ place

154
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,492
and make it an heirloom.

155
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,287
I’m sure my grandma would appreciate it
and put her hands together every day.

156
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,746
Well, I guess so then.

157
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,083
I’ll ask for you, but Reira’s really busy,
so I can’t promise anything.

158
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,126
You’re friends with her?

159
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:47,837
Well, sort of.

160
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,840
That’s amazing, Nana!

161
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,176
Until recently,
you were just a country girl.

162
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,345
I’m gonna call you
a celebrity from now on.

163
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,267
Stop it. I’m just
your average pregnant woman.

164
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,352
Okay, now you’ve got some attitude.

165
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,521
But seeing you now,

166
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,357
I guess running around doing
as you wish is a great skill in a way.

167
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,901
These days, being firm and modest

168
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,154
isn’t enough to get you
on the winning team.

169
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,115
I’ve learned something new.
Congratulations, celebrity!

170
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,700
Keep climbing that social ladder!

171
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,203
Hey, Take.

172
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:25,041
It looks like Ren’s decided to marry Nana.

173
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,459
Huh? Marry her?

174
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,836
So you persuaded him, Takumi?

175
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,631
No, he brought up the subject himself.

176
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,175
And he doesn’t seem to have
any ulterior motives.

177
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,259
That’s good.

178
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,345
-What are you talking about?
-That’s the best.

179
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,388
He’s out buying the ring right now.

180
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,099
We should arrange for him to meet her,
so he can give it to her.

181
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,142
You’re right.

182
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:47,772
With that ring, I’m sure
even Nana will accept it with joy.

183
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,066
We don’t have to worry anymore.

184
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,821
You know, that’s a really big diamond.

185
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,824
A worthless guy like me could never afford
to buy something like that in my lifetime.

186
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,994
I’m happy for you, celebrity,
that you didn’t settle with me.

187
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,747
You make it sound
like I’m some evil woman who dumped you.

188
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,750
But it’s true!
You had me running in circles for you,

189
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,834
and then in the end,
it’s, "I don’t want him!"

190
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,587
-Was I your toy?
-You’re the one who cheated on me!

191
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,797
Sorry.

192
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,383
So you think that apologizing now
will make it all right?

193
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,635
I’m sorry, but it’s in the past, isn’t it?

194
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,887
I’m surprised you can be
so casual about it!

195
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,931
I’m just trying to say what
you wanna hear.

196
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,060
You kept saying how much you loved me,
but it turned out that was all a lie!

197
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,312
I don’t remember ever
actually saying that to you.

198
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,356
I could hear it!

199
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,983
I know! And there’s no way that was a lie!

200
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,028
You know very well
that I’m terrible at lying.

201
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,446
That’s why when I cheated on you,
you found out right away,

202
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,572
and I confessed.

203
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,206
Right away? While we’re at it,
tell me everything.

204
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,166
Why did you cheat on me?

205
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,795
I just gave in to temptation.
Maybe it was the Demon Lord.

206
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,172
But you were dating them both
for a good two weeks.

207
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,676
Hey, Master! If you’re keeping track
of your customers’ criminal records,

208
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,553
you’ll get taken out someday.

209
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,679
Two weeks…

210
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,766
That’s all? What a boring man.

211
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,976
Celebrity!

212
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,488
You’ve changed my opinion of you.

213
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,991
You were keeping
Ren’s best interests in mind.

214
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:22,992
Huh?

215
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,620
Why, of course. I think
about his interests far more than you do.

216
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,207
I seriously worry about him, too!

217
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,378
But if he marries Nana
and she stays with him forever,

218
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,338
it’ll cure his bad habits.

219
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,633
-Oh, that’s what you’re talking about.
-Huh?

220
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,593
It’s okay.

221
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:46,849
He can quit whenever he wants to.
Ren just has no desire to.

222
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:47,850
You think so?

223
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,228
I think Ren wants to quit if he can.

224
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,980
Then he should quit.

225
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:57,568
But even you said you’d quit smoking
for the baby’s sake,

226
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,320
yet you haven’t been able to!

227
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:02,239
Nicotine creates a chemical dependency
in your body,

228
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,283
so quitting is not that easy.

229
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,411
But Ren’s psychological dependency
is also an addiction!

230
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,497
Keep your voice down.

231
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,374
If word gets out about him,
the band’s activities will be suspended.

232
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,503
I’m concerned about it too.
Don’t get so worked up about it.

233
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,547
Be concerned for the sake of Ren,
not for that of the band.

234
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,758
That’s not my role.

235
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,387
Is that why you’re letting him
get married?

236
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,390
He’s a burden to you,
so you want Nana to take on that role?

237
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,228
That’s not it. That’s a different story.

238
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,522
Yes?

239
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,107
Ah, Mr. Narita.

240
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,108
Good afternoon.

241
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,235
MITSURU NARITA (46) PRESIDENT

242
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,529
How does it look? I dyed it blonde.

243
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,364
At your age? That’s ridiculous!

244
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,282
Reira, even if he does look ridiculous,

245
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,535
that’s no way to talk to the president!

246
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,370
What brings you here today?

247
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,080
We’ll be meeting with the agency

248
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,498
-about Reira’s commercial appearance.
-Sexual harassment!

249
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,208
We don’t need you here!

250
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:58,546
Right, for the cosmetics.
That’s great, Reira.

251
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,422
You’ll be admired even more

252
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,549
-by young girls across the country.
-I only wanna do jobs

253
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,883
that require singing!

254
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,385
Stop being selfish.

255
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,345
They’ll be using our song
for the commercial.

256
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,722
Takumi, I heard about Ren.

257
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,975
The sooner we have
a press conference, the better.

258
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,435
We should try
and move things along quickly.

259
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,897
Bye!

260
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,691
BLAH

261
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,693
Takumi! Why does even the president
suddenly want

262
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,444
Ren and Nana to get married?

263
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,363
He’s the one who suggested it
in the first place!

264
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,741
He wanted Ren to announce to the press
that he would protect Nana!

265
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,493
Why now?

266
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:34,290
He said he doesn’t want Ren to look like
he was being used by a woman.

267
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,334
He thinks that by publicly declaring
that they are lovers,

268
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,671
the public will be left
with the impression

269
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,381
that BLAST became popular thanks to us.

270
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:45,968
-That’s ridiculous!
-Well, he’s not very smart.

271
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,429
Simply saying "we’re getting married"

272
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,307
is more persuasive
and leaves a favorable impression.

273
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:56,186
Then Narita will be satisfied,
and we can put this silly party to rest.

274
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,272
So you want them to get married
for your own protection?

275
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,189
Actually, you disgust me!

276
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:04,278
What does the way you feel about me
have anything to do with Ren’s problems?

277
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:08,574
We’re talking business here!
That’s what I hate about you women!

278
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:18,000
Then I’ll point this out strictly
from a business point of view.

279
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:22,463
The core of our fan base is young women.

280
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,382
With that in mind, I don’t think having
you and Ren getting married

281
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,009
one after the other is such a great plan.

282
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,554
If you seriously think all fans
support us for our music only,

283
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,805
you’re delusional.

284
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,226
I get it. Then it would be better
if just Ren got married, right?

285
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,696
Why is Sachiko working
while you’re wandering around?

286
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,073
We work different shifts.

287
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,700
You’ve gotta work more,
so she can take it easy!

288
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,453
But we split the bills fifty-fifty.

289
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,956
That’s one very reliable housewife.

290
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,708
I’d say girls like you
who not only spend a lot

291
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,711
but rely on the earnings of others
to pay for it are a lot less common.

292
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,215
I’m glad you found a guy
with deep pockets.

293
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:10,594
Hey, not that you’d know it,
but I’ve grown up a lot recently.

294
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,388
I know.

295
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,891
Jun-chan, you blabbermouth…

296
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,060
So Nana, who are you going
to the fireworks with?

297
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,687
That’s a secret!

298
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,898
We celebrities have many secrets
that we cannot tell the commoners.

299
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,027
So even if we run into each other,
don’t talk to me, okay?

300
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,113
And I’ll do the same.

301
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,919
&lrm;POST OFFICE

302
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:44,878
I really am sorry.

303
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:54,346
It’s okay. I had many faults too.

304
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:03,689
But thinking back,
none of your selfish whims were that bad.

305
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,402
I might annoy you by saying this,

306
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,864
but I still enjoy talking with you.

307
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,241
I’m glad I could see you.

308
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,412
So I won’t see you anymore.

309
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,000
Those with a record
must refrain, you know.

310
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,086
Bye.

311
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,393
Get going!

312
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,897
You go first. Where are you meeting?

313
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,860
It’s a secret. I still have time,
so I think I’ll wander around a bit.

314
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:53,781
You sure like wandering,
even though you get lost easily.

315
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,658
I don’t get lost anymore! Hurry up and go!

316
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,291
Oh, by the way, when is she due? Sachiko.

317
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,293
The end of April.

318
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:11,548
It’s not possible that she’ll be late
and arrive on May 5th, is it?

319
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,759
Why? It’s perfectly possible.

320
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,302
If she were born on that day,
Children’s Day,

321
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,304
it would be nice
because everyone would remember the day!

322
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,015
Are you sure it’s not
the Demon Lord’s child?

323
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,892
How dare you say something so ominous!

324
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,269
Children of the Demon Lord
can only be born on July 7th.

325
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,187
Let’s hope so.

326
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,149
Well then, take care of yourself.

327
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,526
Give birth to a healthy human baby!

328
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,428
-Hachiko’s late, isn’t she?
-No, it’s only 5:30 p.m.

329
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,557
She doesn’t have a key,
so she won’t be here until six o’clock.

330
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,268
What? She doesn’t have a key?

331
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,232
Yasu, you’re too funny!
I can’t continue a conversation like this!

332
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,026
Mika and Masaru put
all that effort into it,

333
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,528
so you shouldn’t be screwing around.

334
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,614
You’re the one who put it on me.
You even paid for it.

335
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,201
With Yasu, placing wigs on him is so easy!

336
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,413
Shin, quit talking like Misato.
You’re seriously cute like that.

337
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,708
That long hair looks
surprisingly good on you.

338
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,626
I’ll bet Hachi will fall in love
with you all over again.

339
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,920
But I don’t want her to fall in love
with me for that reason.

340
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,966
It makes you look a bit like Shoji.
Though you’re shorter.

341
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,093
I thought so, too. Petite Shoji?

342
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,429
Yeah, he does look like him.
Although Nobu’s shorter.

343
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,641
Who is this Shoji?
And just how tall is he?

344
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:48,604
Shoji!

345
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,155
What’s wrong? Your eyes are red.

346
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,658
Huh? My contact lenses are giving
me problems.

347
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,077
But you have twenty-twenty vision.

348
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,248
Maybe I’m just far-sighted.

349
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,251
The further away something is,
the better I can see it.

350
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,754
But once it gets close,
I lose sight of it.

351
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,217
That could be the same with everyone.

352
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,184
Let’s hold hands all night tonight,

353
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,852
so we don’t lose each other in the crowd,

354
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,022
especially since you’re tiny.

355
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,570
Hey, Hachi…

356
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,074
They say you don’t realize

357
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:46,036
how much you care for someone
until after they’re gone.

358
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:50,082
But I think it’s when you come
face to face with that person once more

359
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,751
that you truly recognize
your feelings for them.

360
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:58,215
If I saw everyone again right now…

361
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,094
I know that I’d depend on them
just as much as I did back then.

362
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:07,391
I’m scared of that.
That’s why I can’t move from this spot.
