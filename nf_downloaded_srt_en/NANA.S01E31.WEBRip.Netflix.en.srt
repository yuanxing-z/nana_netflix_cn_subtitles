1
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:07,632
I knew that Ren wanted a child.

2
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:13,930
I also knew that having a child
wouldn’t stop me from singing.

3
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:22,105
I think I just didn’t have the confidence
to become a mother.

00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,456
REN - FROM 1:00 A.M.
PLEASE RECORD "HUTCH" FOR ME.

6
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,211
You’re here again?

7
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,171
You’re the one who called me over!

8
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,589
Did you videotape it?

9
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:15,301
You keep making such dumb excuses
to get me to come over every day!

10
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,429
What do you mean dumb excuses?

11
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,306
We were both orphans, too.

12
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,393
Watch it, and you’re sure to be in tears.

13
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,562
Cry on your own! I’m going to sleep.

14
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,565
Good morning.

15
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,234
How are you feeling today, Ms. Hachiko?

16
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,862
Fine. Sorry if I made you worry.

17
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,989
I think it’s just
the summer heat getting to me,

18
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,116
but I’ll go see a doctor just in case.

19
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,493
I’d better get well soon,
or I won’t be able to go to work, right?

20
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,329
That’s a good idea! I’ll come with you!

21
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,664
What are you saying?

22
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,002
You need to stay here
and finish your homework today.

23
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,254
Please don’t remind me!

24
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:57,343
Now, stay focused.
I’ll help you when I get back.

25
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,636
Thank you so much.

26
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:04,183
Also, please don’t tell Nana or the others
that I’m not feeling well, okay?

27
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,935
It’s an important time for them
with their debut coming up,

28
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,563
so I don’t want them worrying about me.

29
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:12,650
But I’ll be returning home tomorrow.
Will you be all right on your own?

30
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,196
You should at least talk with Ms. Nana
and have her look after you.

31
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,658
Thanks, but I’ll be all right.

32
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,622
OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
NAKAZATO CLINIC

33
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,042
Ms. Komatsu. Ms. Nana Komatsu.

34
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,884
Your urine test came back positive.
When was your last period?

35
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:41,638
July 16th. It lasted about five days.

36
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:46,142
Should you be pregnant,
are you planning on keeping it?

37
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,948
We’ll begin with a pelvic examination.
The next room please.

38
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,115
Please come in, Ms. Komatsu.

39
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,418
Please take off your underwear
and sit on the examination table.

40
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:17,173
-You may keep your skirt on.
-Ah, yes.

41
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,560
I don't deal well
with inconveniences like that.

42
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,446
Ms. Komatsu, please relax.

43
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,079
I’ll be waiting faithfully.

44
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,255
You are pregnant.

45
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:02,552
This small black circle you see
is the sack that contains your baby.

46
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,681
And the little dot you see
inside is your baby.

47
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,935
Now, we count the first week
from the day of your last period

48
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,562
as week zero,

49
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,690
so you're in the middle
of your sixth week.

50
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,192
If you’re planning on keeping your child,

51
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,112
come for another check-up in two weeks.

52
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,739
If you wish to have an abortion,

53
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:26,743
the sooner the better,
for your body’s sake.

54
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,539
Would you like to take home the photo?

55
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,806
Yes.

56
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,353
What? He grew up abroad? Where?

57
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:59,233
I didn’t get around to asking him.
So you didn’t know either.

58
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,526
Did you know about it?

59
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,073
No. I heard about it from Misato as well
and was surprised at first.

60
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,115
But thinking back, for one,

61
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,867
he didn’t know
about the Tanabata festivities.

62
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,287
This explains some things
I thought were odd about him.

63
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,122
Yeah, I guess so.

64
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,749
But if his parents are Japanese,

65
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,876
I’d think they would’ve at least
told him about Tanabata.

66
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,628
Are you ready to order?

67
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,130
-Have you decided, Ms. Hachiko?
-Yeah.

68
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,549
I’ll have the grapefruit juice.

69
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,760
-Aren’t you eating?
-I’m not hungry.

70
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:30,765
Really? Also two mixed sandwiches
and two café au laits.

71
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:31,891
All right.

72
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,605
Ms. Nana, would it be possible for you

73
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,149
to return to your home
for a while starting tonight?

74
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,237
The truth is, Ms. Hachiko
hasn’t been feeling well lately.

75
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,073
Really? Is that why you look like
you're under the weather?

76
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,826
Oh, but it’s just the summer heat.
I’m all right.

77
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,077
The doctor said so, too.

78
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,079
It's bad enough that
you had to see a doctor?

79
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,497
That’s definitely not all right!

80
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,750
But the doctor said I’m fine,
so it’s all right.

81
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,710
That’s not the issue here.

82
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,674
All right, Misato. I’ll return home
starting tonight, so don’t worry.

83
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,467
Yes. Thank you very much.

84
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,180
Oh, going back to what
I was saying about Shin…

85
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:15,226
I assumed he was half-Japanese.
So without thinking, I told him

86
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:20,189
I wasn't convinced that
his parents were both Japanese.

87
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,444
Then he told me
he wasn't convinced either,

88
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,488
that his parents
shouldn’t have given birth to him.

89
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,491
Ms. Hachiko and I were discussing that.

90
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:36,414
That sort of thinking is like him
denying his own existence.

91
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,211
I’ll come back to get you, Nana, okay?

92
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,720
I’ll be back soon.

93
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,144
No. Denying his parents
and denying his own existence

94
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,729
are two different issues.

95
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,107
Shin’s not a kid anymore.

96
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,986
He should be capable of figuring out
why he deserves to exist.

97
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,237
You think so?

98
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,865
If we put our minds to it,

99
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,284
we're all capable of determining
our own fates.

100
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,621
Right now,
his purpose in life is to work hard

101
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,955
toward the band’s debut.

102
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,082
You’re right! A purpose in life!

103
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,459
-Here you are.
-Me too.

104
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,627
Ever since I found my purpose in life,

105
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,296
to become a diehard BLAST fan,
my life has been nothing but roses.

106
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,214
Roses?

107
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,222
Well then, Ms. Nana, Ms. Hachiko…

108
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,557
I am really grateful for your hospitality.

109
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,018
Please give my regards
to the band members.

110
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,481
Take care, Misato.
Come stay with us again anytime.

111
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:48,319
We’ll definitely become
Japan’s number one band…

112
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,780
for the sake of your purpose in life, too.

113
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,287
What are you crying for?

114
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,123
You made her cry on purpose.
Come on, Nana!

115
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,544
Misato, you would always come
to our shows alone,

116
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,630
ever since you were in junior high school.

117
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,757
I was always worried about that.

118
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,886
Back home, you probably
don’t get along with your parents

119
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,222
or have any close friends.

120
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:21,185
But for you to say out loud
what others may consider foolish,

121
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,188
like your purpose in life,

122
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,816
you have no idea how much it means to me.

123
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,027
Please understand that, Misato.

124
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,076
Now, regarding the situation
with Shin’s family…

125
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,995
Am I the only one who believes
Shin was probably a child

126
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,663
that resulted
from his mother’s affair abroad,

127
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,124
leading to his family falling apart?

128
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,504
I wonder. It certainly seems possible.

129
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,382
But why did she have the baby?

130
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,176
It's such a gamble not knowing
who the father is.

131
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,763
Even if the guy she was having
the affair with was using protection,

132
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,890
you can never really be sure, can you?

133
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,519
When people get carried away
with passion and lose reason,

134
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,354
you’re not always as careful
as you should be.

135
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,316
Regardless, whatever the situation,

136
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,152
there’s no doubt that Shin’s parents
are irresponsible.

137
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,695
If they can't raise a child properly,

138
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,904
they shouldn’t have given birth to him.

139
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,532
No, I haven’t seen her since I was four.

140
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,535
She ran off with a guy.

141
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,081
There are too many mothers in this world
who think giving birth is a joke.

142
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,841
I don’t think she thought it was a joke.

143
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,470
Maybe there was a reason
she couldn't raise him right.

144
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,432
Maybe there were circumstances
beyond her control.

145
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,893
It’s only natural that an expectant mother

146
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,520
would wanna give birth
and raise her child.

147
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,230
Why is it only natural?

148
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,858
Well, you see…

149
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,738
I can’t really explain it.

150
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,366
Like, maternal instinct?

151
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,370
Is something wrong?

152
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,416
No. I’ve been so busy,
I thought I’d come to get them when I can,

153
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,377
in case I’m not able
to come when I need to.

154
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,963
Then should I write you
a two-month prescription?

155
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,095
What’s the matter?

156
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,723
Um, this may be
a strange thing to ask, but…

157
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:28,813
I’m not so sure what people mean
when they talk about maternal instinct.

158
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,440
Is it something every woman normally has?

159
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:38,197
I believe so.
It’s a female instinct after all.

160
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:45,037
However, just because all women
have it within them

161
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,499
doesn’t mean all women use it.

162
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,959
I think that applies to anything.

163
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,294
I believe it’s something within a woman

164
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,131
that is awakened
by the woman’s situation and needs.

165
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:02,805
Then, if for example,
I was expecting Ren’s baby right now,

166
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,601
would I wanna give birth
even though I’d know

167
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:12,022
it would be nothing but trouble
just before my professional debut?

168
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:17,319
And not for Ren’s sake,
but due to my instinct?

169
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,908
That’s just not possible.

170
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,666
My stomach hurts.

171
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:37,006
Why does your stomach hurt
like this every day?

172
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,175
Do you hate to practice that much?

173
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,051
I hate you, Nana!

174
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,430
Hachi would be a lot kinder to me!

175
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,517
I wanna see Hachi!
Why won’t she come to the studio?

176
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,436
Because she doesn’t wanna bother us.

177
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,896
This isn’t some playground after all.

178
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,732
But Mr. Kawano said it’s okay.

179
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,108
He may have said so,

180
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,526
but still, you'd normally
feel uncomfortable coming.

181
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,696
That’s not fair, Nobu,
keeping Hachi all to yourself.

182
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,282
I haven’t seen her since the day
of the fireworks either!

183
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,494
Huh? Why?

184
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,787
We have band practice
until late every night,

185
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,331
and we both work during the day.

186
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,124
We have no time to meet.

187
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:16,378
But she'd come see you
every night until recently.

188
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,547
She won’t come even if I ask.

189
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,549
She’s probably having her period.

190
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,550
CONVINCED

191
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:26,138
You went together with Nana
to see Misato off today, right?

192
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,933
You should’ve insisted
on having her come today.

193
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,393
No, she wasn’t looking too well.

194
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,686
What do you mean she wasn’t looking well?

195
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,438
It’s just summer heat fatigue.

196
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,815
I guess that's what the doctor said, too.
She'll be fine.

197
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,651
It's bad enough she had to see a doctor?

198
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,237
Bye.

199
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,947
If you wanna become number one,

200
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,282
be prepared to not take a break
even to be by your parents’ deathbed.

201
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,826
I don't like this strict band…

202
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,036
Hey, Shin! Where are you going?

203
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,038
I told you, my stomach hurts!

204
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,374
Does he really wanna do this?

205
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,960
At least let him go to the bathroom
when he has to.

206
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,504
You seriously lack the sense
of kindness to others!

207
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,341
And you guys lack the sense
to be suspicious of others.

208
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,970
Or maybe Shin's body reacts funny
when the nicotine level gets low,

209
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,097
and he gets a stomachache.

210
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:25,906
I enjoyed commuting to that
cheap studio we used before a lot more.

211
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,159
I could smoke, and Hachi was there, too.

212
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,288
Like I said, Mr. Kawano…

213
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,747
It’s ludicrous to try

214
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,625
and make a top-selling band
outta some punk band.

215
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,919
I know it’s a dream you’ve had
for a long time,

216
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,004
but during these tough times,

217
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:44,425
you’ve gotta realize that the company’s
not about to invest in a risky, new band.

218
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,635
But there aren’t any competitors
in the same genre.

219
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,387
If they do well, this’ll be big.

220
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,432
And the sheer presence of Nana,
the vocalist, is simply breathtaking.

221
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,268
Sure, overall,
they’re a visually attractive band,

222
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:59,148
but punks in bondage outfits
are so outdated.

223
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,149
BONDAGE

224
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,737
Actually, I think it’s a fresh look
for teenagers.

225
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,614
I used to dress like that
when I was young.

226
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,740
I was leaner, too.

227
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:11,118
Well, we could always hire a stylist
and get their fashion up to date.

228
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,369
I wouldn’t want that!

229
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,580
But the main problem is their sound.

230
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,000
It’s not bad, but it’s too ordinary.

231
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,209
They may be popular performing live,

232
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,670
but on a CD, their music
will lack any true impact.

233
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,840
But that’s where you
as the director need to show your skills.

234
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,343
If we can’t get a decent budget
to promote them,

235
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,136
I can’t find the motivation.

236
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,138
I wish you’d give this up already.

237
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,739
If they’re not able to raise
a child properly,

238
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,658
they shouldn’t have given birth to him.

239
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,160
There are too many mothers in this world
who think giving birth is a joke.

240
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,454
YOU HAVE ONE NEW MESSAGE

241
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,335
FROM NOBU - I’M ON MY WAY HOME.
WE JUST FINISHED PRACTICE.

242
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,419
I HEAR YOU’RE NOT FEELING WELL.

243
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,963
IF YOU’RE STILL AWAKE,
GIVE ME A CALL, AND I’LL COME BY.

244
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,678
If you wish to have an abortion,
the sooner the better.

245
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,522
I’ll return home starting tonight,
so don’t worry.

246
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,533
Nana?

247
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,369
It’s me.

248
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,088
Nana, open up.

249
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,926
Please open the door.

250
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,265
Oh, shoot! Someone’s coming!

251
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,979
Don’t believe a thing I say.

252
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,982
What are you doing here? Go home!

253
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,408
At times like this,

254
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,578
what’s the best thing to do
if I don’t wanna leave?

255
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,348
Hey, this isn’t funny.

256
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,983
Hey, are you all right?

257
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,195
Do you wanna see a doctor?

258
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,745
-Morning sickness?
-I won’t keep it, so don’t worry!

259
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,583
There’s no need for you
to feel responsible, Takumi.

260
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,668
I’m the foolish one.

261
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,755
And of course,
this child could be my boyfriend’s.

262
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,927
Go home. And don’t come back again.

263
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,390
Is your boyfriend Nobu?

264
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,654
All right. I get it.

265
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,570
Takumi?

266
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,656
CONTACTS

267
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:18,907
What are you doing?

268
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,954
My cell phone? Hey…

269
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,164
NAO - NAKAGAWA - NAKAMURA - NANA - NAMI

270
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,959
Takumi…

271
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,379
NOBU

272
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,381
Don’t tell Nobu!

273
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,013
Garlic is the best
for summer heat fatigue.

274
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,390
Are you thinking of coming with me?

275
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,517
She didn’t call you,
so she must be sleeping.

276
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,227
Let me at least see her sleeping face.

277
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,065
Telepathy!

278
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,027
I got it, so answer already!
You’re so annoying!

279
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,530
-Hello!
-Oh, Nobu? It’s Takumi.

280
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,666
What is it?

281
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,836
-Hey, can you hear me?
-Yes.

282
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,839
Nana’s pregnant.

283
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,968
I don’t know if it’s yours or mine,

284
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,263
but regardless, if Nana wants to keep it,

285
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,099
I intend on becoming its guardian
and raising it as my own.

286
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,150
What do you think?

287
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,117
You know, Hachi…

288
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:51,124
I still believe life
is what we make of it.

289
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:58,507
But I’m now able to recognize that
not everyone can be strong all the time.

290
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,801
Because of that,

291
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,929
I’ve become that much kinder
than I was back then.
