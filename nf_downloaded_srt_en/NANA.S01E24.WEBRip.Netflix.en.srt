1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,132
That night, I became worried about Nana

2
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:11,261
since she hadn’t replied
to the email I sent her.

3
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:14,472
That worry soon turned to anxiety.

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,560
As it passed midnight, unable to bear it,

5
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,687
I reached for my cell phone.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,109
That's when it rang to indicate
that I had just received an email.

7
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:29,029
I’LL BE STAYING AT REN’S PLACE TONIGHT.

8
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:32,657
I’LL LISTEN TO YOUR STORY TOMORROW,

9
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:36,119
SO DON'T WORRY AND GO TO SLEEP, HACHIKO.

10
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:54,095
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

11
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,543
You know, I’m actually half-Japanese.

12
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,879
My dad is American.

13
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,882
He got sick and died when I was six.

14
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,303
But when Japanese people hear
that I’m half-American,

15
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,222
they conclude that
I’m pretty because of that,

16
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,142
and that’s why I have a good voice.

17
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,894
So our talent agency advised us
to keep it a secret,

18
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,938
so people would think I’m super talented

19
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,399
in spite of me being Japanese
just like everyone else.

20
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:36,030
I don’t care either way,
as long as I can sing.

21
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:41,286
The people around me can be pests
in other ways, too.

22
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:45,165
Like they tell me not to do
or say anything that’ll hurt my image.

23
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,335
Hurt my image or not, this is who I am.

24
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,842
Being human can be so tiring.

25
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,141
The next day, it started raining hard
early in the morning.

26
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,352
As a result, people were scarce
at the supermarket where I worked.

27
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,231
The smell of the dumplings
that wouldn’t sell

28
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:14,777
lingered on my hair and clothes,
making work totally unbearable.

29
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,949
So you failed to go through with it.

30
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,409
Shut up!

31
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:26,581
But even Hachi must have figured out
your feelings for her, Nobu.

32
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:27,999
She could be at a loss right now

33
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,585
since you only partially confessed
your feelings to her.

34
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,420
What am I doing, causing her problems?

35
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,215
These aren’t any good.

36
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,382
Do you have a lighter?

37
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:41,471
I don’t. Say, where did you forget
that huge lighter you had?

38
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,432
How do you lose something you wear
around your neck?

39
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,268
What am I gonna do? I really liked it too.

40
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,730
It’s a rare item,
so it's hard to find another one.

41
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:54,234
It’s divine punishment.
You’ve upset the Demon Lord.

42
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,736
You think so?

43
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,654
Huh?

44
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,365
Hey, Yasu.

45
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,741
-Where’s Nana?
-Not here yet.

46
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,077
So how did it go with the record company?

47
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,787
I’ll tell you when Nana gets here.

48
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,205
Come on, you can tell us.

49
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,331
What are you talking about?

50
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,499
Oh, Shin.

51
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:13,002
I couldn’t reach you
on your cell since last night.

52
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:13,962
You had me worried.

53
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,299
I’m glad to see you’re alive.

54
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,719
Another woman. Give it a rest, would you?

55
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,304
It’s work.

56
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,515
Don’t call it work!

57
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,558
Yasu!

58
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,644
How did it go with the record company?

59
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,437
Like I said, what are you talking about?

60
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,858
You’ve been scouted?

61
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,861
Wait… Wait a minute…

62
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,030
Calm… Calm down…
You need to calm down, Nana!

63
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,865
You’re the one who needs to calm down.

64
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,078
Okay, now calm down,

65
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,705
and you shall tell me what happened
in the proper order.

66
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,956
"You shall"?

67
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,749
What happened was,

68
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,043
we casually distributed demo tapes
and a video of our live concert

69
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,837
to various record companies.

70
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,799
Then one of them liked
what they saw and contacted us.

71
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,927
Gaia Records.

72
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,098
That’s a super famous label!
Even I know them!

73
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,309
Yeah, I guess.
Biggest in the music industry.

74
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,852
Will you be able to debut?

75
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,814
No, not yet. We’re not quite there yet.

76
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:15,940
Aww…

77
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,444
You know, Yasu met
with a guy from Gaia today.

78
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:23,323
He apparently wants to come
to our next concert.

79
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:27,201
If we do well,
he’ll seriously consider signing us.

80
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,538
I see. Then I’m sure things will go well.

81
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,582
The live performance of BLAST
is outta this world after all.

82
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,168
Right? We’ve practically won this battle.

83
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,252
It’ll be a breeze!

84
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,130
A breeze? You’re beaming with confidence.

85
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:44,218
When’s your next live concert?
The end of the month, isn’t it?

86
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,430
-The 28th.
-We’d better let Misato know.

87
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:51,184
We were all pumped up at practice today.

88
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,728
Nobu’s guitar strings kept snapping.

89
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,272
I promise you, one day,
I’ll be better than him.

90
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,233
Takumi.

91
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,448
You should’ve come after work today.

92
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,785
You know… Nana…

93
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:13,164
Yesterday… Er…
The day before yesterday? Huh?

94
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:18,461
Anyway, the day
of Trapnest’s final concert.

95
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,464
Takumi came here late that night.

96
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:25,718
Yeah, I know.
Actually, I saw you all lovey-dovey.

97
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,721
I called out to you,
but you didn’t even notice me.

98
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,225
I knew it. I’m sorry.

99
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,851
Wh-- What about?

100
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:38,606
That time, I wasn’t thinking clearly.
I’ll bet you were surprised.

101
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,110
I hadn’t told you anything prior to that.

102
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,403
Yeah, I was surprised,

103
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,114
but there’s nothing
to apologize about, is there?

104
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,491
Since the fact that Takumi
came to our place

105
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,493
meant that the party was over,

106
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:54,580
I figured you had gone out to see Ren.

107
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,125
But then I started thinking that
you might’ve left out of courtesy to us,

108
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,876
and I started getting concerned.

109
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,503
No, you’re wrong.

110
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,839
I got an email from Ren,
so I went to see him.

111
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,632
I see. Thank goodness.

112
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:08,344
But Nana, you told me that
you won’t have Ren stay over

113
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,346
because I’d feel obligated
to be hospitable.

114
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,557
I’ll be more careful from now on, too.

115
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,308
No, never mind.

116
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,353
Actually, I’m thinking of staying
at Ren’s place for a while.

117
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,564
-Huh?
-Want a drink?

118
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:23,109
Yes. Or, ah…
You’re gonna stay at Ren’s place?

119
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,737
Just for the two weeks
that Trapnest has off.

120
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,824
He tells me they rarely get
this much time to themselves,

121
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,075
so I thought I’d be with him
during that time.

122
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,331
I see. Well, naturally,

123
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,417
of course she’d wanna be with Ren.

124
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,670
So the same goes for you.

125
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,881
Don’t hesitate to have Takumi
come here every day

126
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,215
during that period.

127
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,885
He’s not likely to come here every day.

128
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,305
Takumi told me he’s busy
even during the days he’s off.

129
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,308
But I guess that could be a lie.

130
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,769
No, I don’t think it’s a lie.

131
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,189
Since he’s normally really busy,
it’s likely that

132
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,066
he has a ton of non-work related stuff
to catch up on.

133
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,153
Ren was saying something
similar to that, too.

134
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,070
I’m glad.

135
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:12,492
It’s gonna be all right.
He’ll be here again soon.

136
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:17,079
I didn't think you'd cheer me on
like this.

137
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,542
That’s why I couldn’t bring myself
to tell you.

138
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,962
-I’m sorry.
-Why?

139
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,007
I thought you’d despise me.

140
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,425
Despise you?

141
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,970
Sleeping with my favorite musician
and stuff.

142
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,056
That’s just plain foolish,
don’t you think?

143
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,934
Even I think it’s foolish.

144
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,560
What are you saying?

145
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,105
Sure, Takumi may just happen
to be a successful musician,

146
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:47,151
but regardless of that fact,
you’ve fallen in love with him, right?

147
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,487
Regardless?

148
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,404
Yeah.

149
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,281
I wonder.

150
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,994
To me, Takumi is simply
Takumi from Trapnest.

151
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,497
I’ve never thought of him
as anything else.

152
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,375
When I think of him as some random guy,

153
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,669
he does seem to be
a really horrible person.

154
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,046
You know…

155
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,091
I can’t stand girls who’d casually sleep
with a guy like that

156
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:13,094
just for the thrill of doing it
with a celebrity.

157
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,388
But how could I despise you

158
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:20,059
after seeing you shed tears
like that in his arms?

159
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:25,231
Even Takumi must’ve felt pure love for you

160
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,109
when he saw you cry like that
straight from your heart.

161
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,279
If he didn’t feel love,
he would’ve been uncomfortable.

162
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,657
Like, "What mess did I get myself into
having a girl cry on me like this?"

163
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,576
So it’s gonna be all right.

164
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,743
Good luck.

165
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,545
People close to you may worry
and say things to you regarding Takumi.

166
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,339
Yasu especially has a tendency to worry.

167
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,424
But don’t let it bother you.

168
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,593
Which reminds me, Nana. About that…

169
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,886
About what?

170
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,056
About me and Takumi… you know…

171
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,101
You were saying that you saw us.

172
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,603
Did you tell everyone about it, Nana?

173
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,857
Sorry. I did tell Yasu. Is that bad?

174
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,027
No, it’s not about Yasu, but rather Nobu.

175
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,613
I wonder if Yasu told him anything.

176
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,822
No, that’s not it!

177
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,366
Nobu and Shin heard it
from Takumi at the party.

178
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,954
He said that she was wagging
her tail looking all pleased.

179
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,205
Then Nobu lost it.

180
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,540
What did you just say?

181
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,751
Well, but he didn’t mean any disrespect.

182
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:32,131
And the fact that he went to see Hachi
after that is so unlike him.

183
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:35,843
He usually hates getting
into such hassle over a woman.

184
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,012
When Shin poured his drink over Takumi,

185
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,972
I was sure he’d never want
anything to do with her again,

186
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,476
but I guess he does have
feelings for Hachiko.

187
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,688
What did Takumi tell them at the party?

188
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:53,486
It seems that he told everyone
that you two started going out.

189
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,447
That we’re going out?

190
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,617
I’ll bet he casually
and jokingly told everyone

191
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,495
that "I did it with her"
in that way he always acts.

192
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,288
You know him well.

193
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,124
But what was that about Nobu
that you brought up a moment ago?

194
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,168
Did something happen with Nobu?

195
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,133
What happened is… last night…

196
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,136
Nobu suddenly showed up
and said he needed to talk to me.

197
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,680
He said something
about becoming better than Takumi

198
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,808
or something like that…

199
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,894
I’m not really sure what
that was all about, but… well…

200
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,688
Yeah. In other words,
he came to confess his love.

201
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,107
You think that was what it was, too?

202
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,609
But it’s not as if he actually said that.

203
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,861
He probably couldn’t.

204
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,698
You know, everyone’s sort of caught on
to the fact that he’s in love with you.

205
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,829
I had no idea about that!
What am I gonna do?

206
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:48,332
Oh. So that’s why you didn’t drop
by the studio today?

207
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,375
Well…

208
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,585
Don’t worry about it.

209
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,337
There’s nothing you can really do
about it, is there?

210
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,424
Since you love Takumi.

211
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,218
But…

212
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,304
So you’re saying Nana’s met her soulmate?

213
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,349
I actually believe in that kind of stuff,
being a romantic guy and all.

214
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,768
But I’d be satisfied
with a happiness closer to home.

215
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:08,769
There’s not a single thing
I’m superior in.

216
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,812
It’s impossible.

217
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,730
I can’t compete against him.

218
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,151
I can’t just leave it at that.

219
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,735
I’ve gotta make things clear.

220
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,113
If you know that,
then don’t just sit there grumbling.

221
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,574
Go and follow up on what you told her.

222
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,493
Should Hachi never set foot
in the studio again,

223
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,828
it’ll all be your fault.

224
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:29,165
I’m going in for the attack
knowing I’m gonna get shot down.

225
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,833
I feel like I’m on a suicide mission.

226
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,251
A suicide mission?

227
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:36,088
Shit! If only there was one thing
I could beat him at!

228
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,131
Sure there is.

229
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,090
What?

230
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,342
My phone.

231
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,804
Aren’t you gonna answer it?

232
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,849
-I’m going out.
-Work?

233
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,851
Don’t get arrested.

234
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,192
You can’t go on stealing
other people’s clothes!

235
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,485
And that's my best suit!

236
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,864
Wait, Shin. Answer my question!

237
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,366
What can I beat him at?

238
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,202
Love.

239
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,876
Hello, Shin here.

240
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,881
Yes. Yes, I’m sorry. I was being careless.

241
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,260
Then can I go now to pick it up?

242
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,418
You forgot it on purpose, didn’t you?

243
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,341
Come on in.

244
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:07,846
Reira.

245
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,393
Payment in advance.

246
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,759
The wind carried Nana’s song to my ears.

247
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,179
It’s the same song Nobu played
on that cassette player

248
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,265
the day he came to Tokyo.

249
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:56,353
That song’s my number one
favorite song in the world.

250
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,027
That girl…

251
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,864
Ms. Yamada-whose-age-is-a-mystery
will come yelling again.

252
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:20,169
I’m sorry about suddenly
coming over last night

253
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,129
and blurting out weird nonsense.

254
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,216
So now that I’ve come to see you
like this again,

255
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,052
this time, I’m gonna be direct with you.

256
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,028
I love you.

257
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,290
That’s not what I had in mind
when I asked you to come in.

258
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,793
Then I have no reason to be here,
so I’m going home.

259
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,795
Don’t you want your lighter?

260
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,922
If you want it, you can have it.

261
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,271
I’m sorry, Shin.

262
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,400
You can have it back, so don’t be mad.

263
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,820
&lrm;FIRE HOSE CABINET

264
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,822
It’s a lie that I charge
one hundred thousand a night.

265
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,451
I occasionally receive expensive gifts,

266
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:38,205
but I had never had someone hand me
100,000 yen in cash.

267
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,793
It’s the first time you ever bought
a man, isn’t it, Reira?

268
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,171
You fooled me at first
with your act as a naughty girl,

269
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,257
but I can easily tell whether or not

270
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,300
a girl’s had a history of fooling around
once we get into bed.

271
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,553
You don’t have to try and be so tough.

272
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,141
I do feel uneasy about accepting
100,000 for that,

273
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,560
so if you’d like,
I will spend another night with you.

274
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,354
Call me whenever you feel up to it.

275
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,400
Good night, Reira. Sweet dreams.

276
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,547
My soul is confused.

277
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,760
My heart is shaking.

278
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:41,143
I feel as if I made a big mistake.

279
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:49,735
I know that I’m not being fair
by saying this now,

280
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,695
since I know about you and Takumi.

281
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,698
I didn’t want you to know.

282
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,410
You’re in love with him, aren’t you?

283
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:03,415
I really didn’t want anyone to know.

284
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:09,046
I wonder, do I really love Takumi?

285
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:15,052
Maybe I just wanna convince myself
that it was okay to sleep with him.

286
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,850
I don’t know anymore.

287
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,688
I’m sorry.

288
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,983
You couldn’t come to the studio today
even if you wanted to

289
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,194
because of what I said, right?

290
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,364
I’m sorry, that’s not it!
I was working today!

291
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,618
I don’t mind,
so please drop by like you’ve been doing.

292
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,037
Everyone feels a bit lonely
without your presence, Hachi.

293
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,414
Actually, it’s me who gets sad.

294
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,209
Thank you.

295
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,921
Thank goodness.

296
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,434
That’s good enough for me.

297
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,859
What should I do?

298
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,945
I feel so happy.

299
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,907
Be mine forever.

300
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:25,455
I’m many times happier now than
when hearing those words from Takumi

301
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,542
which I can’t be sure are true or not.

302
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:36,008
What good is it to keep
this empty cigarette pack?

303
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,264
If this hadn’t happened
between Takumi and me,

304
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,017
I’m sure I would’ve fallen for Nobu.

305
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,896
I would’ve loved to be Nobu’s girlfriend.

306
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,357
But if Takumi were to come
and see me again,

307
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,902
I’d likely end up sleeping with him again.

308
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,570
I probably won’t resist it.

309
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,365
What in the world do I want?

310
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,537
If I always get carried away like this,
I’ll never get my hands on anything.

311
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:19,259
When I woke up the next morning,
Nana was no longer there.

312
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,888
There was a note on the table.

313
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,014
TO HACHIKO
DON’T FORGET TO LOCK THE DOOR.

314
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,731
It’s not something
I should be feeling lonely about.

315
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,692
I can see her whenever I want
at the studio.

316
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,486
Besides, it’s only for two weeks.

317
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:44,534
After those two weeks…
she will return here, won’t she?

318
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,119
TO HACHIKO
DON’T FORGET TO LOCK THE DOOR.

319
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,329
LOSE THAT HABIT OF OPENING
THE DOOR TO ANYONE WITHOUT

320
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,580
CONFIRMING WHO IT IS FIRST.
NANA

321
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:53,919
Hey Nana… Even now, not a day passes

322
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,588
without me wishing to see you
on the other side of that table.

323
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,051
I would call out your name from my heart,

324
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,971
many times,

325
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,807
as many times as it takes.
