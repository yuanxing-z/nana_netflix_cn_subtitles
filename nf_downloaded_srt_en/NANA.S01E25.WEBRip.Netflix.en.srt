1
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:07,215
During the two weeks that Nana was gone,

2
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:10,677
I took on extra work,
so I’d be busy every day,

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,388
and worked until I was
absolutely exhausted.

4
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,057
I did this to keep my mind off
of how lonely I was.

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,854
Yet I went to the practice sessions
at the studio without fail.

6
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,691
Then Nobu would always walk me home.

7
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,446
I hadn’t heard from Takumi at all.

8
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:57,932
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

9
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,003
I’m thinking about going on a trip.

10
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,713
Hey, that sounds nice.

11
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,006
Don't forget my souvenir.

12
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,509
I’m finished.

13
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,263
So where do you wanna go?

14
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,973
Go on your own.

15
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,142
You might have the time, but I’m busy.

16
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,977
Take some time off work.

17
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,687
We have an important concert coming up,

18
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,855
so I have to practice every day.

19
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,110
What’s that? Are you on the pill again?

20
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,237
It’s your fault!
If you want a child that badly,

21
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,613
have some other woman
give birth to one for you.

22
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,908
You don’t mind
if I sleep with another woman?

23
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,828
You’re such a cold woman.

24
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,413
You just realized that now?

25
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,167
I’m gonna go write a song

26
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,628
for the cute Reira.

27
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,397
Oh, Shin. You’re awake.

28
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,025
Good morning, Ms. Ryoko.

29
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,613
I’ll be flying out again tomorrow.
To the States.

30
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,281
So I won’t be seeing you for a while.

31
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,576
But I’ll bring back a bunch of gifts,
so keep your hopes high.

32
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,911
So you’ll be going.

33
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,663
I’ll be lonely without you, Ms. Ryoko.

34
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,333
Oh, my. You’re not only good
with your technique,

35
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,209
but you’ve also improved
your choice of words.

36
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,086
Perhaps it’s due
to my great teaching skills.

37
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,298
I am grateful.
Thanks to you, business is thriving.

38
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,304
I’ve turned an angel into a devil.

39
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,766
Up close,

40
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,559
I guess you don’t look much
like her after all.

41
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,770
Huh? What did you say?

42
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,064
No. Nothing. Seconds please!

43
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,324
Yasu!

44
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,285
Long time no see.

45
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,829
You haven’t changed one bit.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

46
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,666
Oh, one stout beer please.
How are you doing?

47
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,626
I’m glad to finally meet up with you.

48
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,836
That’s because you keep pestering me.

49
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,507
I invited Reira too,
but she’s back in her hometown.

50
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,841
She really wanted to come.

51
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,093
Is that so?

52
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,095
By the way, Naoki, your voice is too loud.

53
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,223
You’re a celebrity now,
so you’d be wise to keep a low profile.

54
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,516
Not to worry.

55
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,142
The customers here are all
from the entertainment industry.

56
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,769
Really?

57
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:33,022
By the way, Yasu, I heard you came
to Tokyo to go pro.

58
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,525
Reira was complaining that
she’s not happy with your decision.

59
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,820
Yeah, I guessed as much.
That’s why I don’t wanna see her.

60
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,530
She’ll keep teasing me about it.

61
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,865
Well, of course she’d tease you.

62
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,909
What in the world happened
to make you change your mind?

63
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,995
Let’s see.

64
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:50,915
You could say I feel responsible
for the band like it's my child.

65
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,043
What’s that supposed to mean?
You really haven’t changed, Yasu.

66
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,837
You need to let it all out sometimes.

67
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,964
Go wild for a change.

68
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,134
Though I suggest not becoming
as violent as Takumi.

69
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,969
When he loses it, he becomes a criminal.

70
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,179
Although he’s been quite calm as of late,

71
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,723
perhaps from fear of becoming
the next gossip item.

72
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,640
Back in junior high school,

73
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,977
none of the windows had
glass because of him.

74
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,854
Yeah, I remember that.

75
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,982
Speaking of Takumi,
I can’t reach him on his cell phone.

76
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:16,941
What’s he up to?

77
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,735
I don’t know, but…

78
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,821
He’s probably visiting women,
one after another.

79
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,072
There’s no need to worry about him.

80
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,492
Is that so?

81
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,745
Reira, what are you doing?

82
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,666
-Visiting my hometown.
-Oh right. Of course.

83
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,169
You startled me.
How long have you been here?

84
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,254
-Thirty minutes.
-Huh?

85
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,092
I’ve been here staring at you
like this for thirty minutes,

86
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,260
but you didn’t notice me at all, Takumi.

87
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,887
I'm exhausted.

88
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,640
No, I meant how long
have you been in town.

89
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,934
Anyway, if you’ve been staring at me,
the least you could do is say something!

90
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,519
I’ve been here for three days.

91
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,063
I was visiting mother’s grave just now.

92
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,191
But your mother is still alive.

93
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,026
Your mother, Takumi.

94
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,153
Due to work, you couldn’t be
here for the ceremony

95
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,072
marking seven years after her passing,

96
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:50,326
so I prayed that she may
warmly protect her careless son

97
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,079
from the wrath of the gods.

98
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,705
Well, thanks for that.

99
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,417
Is your father doing okay?
Maybe I should go and say hi.

100
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,544
Don’t bother.

101
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,921
He’s the same as always,
drinking from early in the day.

102
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:05,133
That’s gotta be tough
for your elder sister and her husband.

103
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,551
With a little brother like this
on top of it.

104
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,261
You know, if you’re gonna worry
about someone,

105
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,012
worry about your own mother!

106
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,931
Leaving her alone way out here
in the countryside.

107
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:18,187
But she says
she doesn’t wanna go to Tokyo.

108
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,690
She really likes this place.

109
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,944
I don’t get it.

110
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,780
What’s so good about this place
way out in the countryside?

111
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,825
Especially given the fact
she lived in New York at one point.

112
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:35,746
Isn’t that why?
Living abroad didn’t suit her at all.

113
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,708
I’ve been telling her Tokyo
isn’t a foreign country.

114
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,672
But I kinda miss New York.
It’s my birthplace after all.

115
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,882
Why not go there?

116
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,676
Though we only have two more days off.

117
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,178
You should’ve gone.

118
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,347
Hmm… But I had a number of things to do.

119
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,850
Besides, we all should pay our respects
to our parents once in a while.

120
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,269
We came so close on our tour
the other day,

121
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,771
but I couldn’t visit because
of our tight schedule.

122
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,689
What about you, Takumi?

123
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:05,318
As long as I stay in Tokyo,
I end up working.

124
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,819
So I thought I’d wander off
to the countryside.

125
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,446
Call it an escape.

126
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:12,825
But I can’t keep my mind off work,
so I’ll be returning now.

127
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,786
I just stopped by here for a bit.

128
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,788
Huh, you’re going back?

129
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:21,042
We got to meet here,
so why not have some fun together?

130
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,752
Give me a break.

131
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,880
Give me a chance to be alone
on our off days. See ya.

132
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,264
Oh, Reira…

133
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,937
We’ve got a photo shoot
for a magazine next week,

134
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,104
so don’t get tanned.

135
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,774
I’m aware of that, leader.

136
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:52,240
What is that Takumi guy doing?

137
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,408
His time off is coming to an end.

138
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,786
But I didn’t contact him either.

139
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:00,122
Why didn’t you?
You have no reason to hold back.

140
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,459
You should send him a bunch
of emails daily and keep his mind on you.

141
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,837
But I don’t wanna contact him
only to be ignored.

142
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,839
He may be in less of a position
to contact you

143
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:09,840
once he's back to work.

144
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,843
Yes. But it’s okay if that’s how it goes.

145
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,598
Yasu! Aren’t you worried about Hachi?

146
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:21,060
Don’t you get the urge to call Takumi
and give him an earful?

147
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,355
Sure. But I can’t get through
to him on his cell.

148
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,942
Nana! If he came to see me
because someone around him told him to,

149
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,277
that’s not gonna make me too happy!

150
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,613
I really am fine, so don’t worry!

151
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,075
The way I said that…

152
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,370
to them it probably sounds like
I’m trying to be strong about this.

153
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,956
But the honest truth is,

154
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:46,168
if Takumi were to never call me again,
I’d be fine with that.

155
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,047
Or in fact, it would be better that way.

156
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,426
Hachi! Buy one for me too!

157
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,719
Buy it yourself.

158
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,763
What should I get?

159
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,603
You know, Nana’s singing seems
to be improving day by day,

160
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,605
don’t you think?

161
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,898
Maybe because of the sit-ups.

162
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,609
I'm sure we'd be able to go pro, right?

163
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,862
Trapnest will be on their break
for two more days.

164
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,865
If I don’t hear from Takumi again,

165
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:03,120
I can become the poor girl
who was tricked and dumped by a nasty guy.

166
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:07,792
I can make it all Takumi’s fault
and move on to a new love.

167
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:14,590
But if he found out
about my cunning thoughts,

168
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,092
he’ll end up hating me.

169
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,303
First of all, I’d be dreaming

170
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,263
to think someone would
make me their girlfriend

171
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,306
because Takumi dumped me.

172
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,268
I don’t want Nobu thinking
I’m such an easy woman.

173
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,524
But the fact is, I am that type of woman.

174
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,446
A black, four-wheel drive Mercedes Benz.

175
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,370
Nobu!

176
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,747
-Thank you for walking me home.
-Huh?

177
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,833
I’ll be fine on my own from here on.

178
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,292
It's just around the corner.

179
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,961
I’m sorry for having you take
a longer route home

180
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,338
to walk me home every day.

181
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,298
No, I don’t mind it.

182
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:57,800
If you’re bothered by it,

183
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,843
I’ll have Shin or Yasu walk you home
from tomorrow…

184
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,553
No, it doesn’t bother me.

185
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,804
Nana!

186
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,603
If he’s gonna come at this stage,

187
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,023
he could’ve sent me
an email ahead of time.

188
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,651
Such a selfish man
who makes decisions on a whim.

189
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,071
Well, well. It’s you.

190
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,536
Where were you this late at night?

191
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,539
I worry, you know.
I’ve been waiting for an hour.

192
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:33,544
Ah, sorry. I was at the studio
to see Nana and her band practice.

193
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,213
Nana’s staying with Ren now,

194
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:40,009
so Nobu walked me home
because I'm afraid to walk alone.

195
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,678
Is that so?
Well, thank you very much for that.

196
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,930
Okay, then. Thank you, Nobu.

197
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,517
Good night.

198
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,105
I’m the worst.

199
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,234
Sorry for coming like this
out of the blue.

200
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,905
I left my place without my cell phone
and came here before returning,

201
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,281
so I couldn’t call you.

202
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:05,034
This is what happens
when I think cunning thoughts

203
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,535
and take advantage of Nobu’s kindness

204
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,329
by having him walk me home.

205
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,247
I must’ve really hurt his feelings.

206
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:17,129
What am I gonna do?
I can’t go to the studio anymore.

207
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,799
I won’t be able to look him in the eye!

208
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,140
Oh, Takumi, want me to make you something?

209
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,058
Are you hungry?

210
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,018
No.

211
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,564
Then do you want something to drink?

212
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,733
-There’s cold beer.
-Sure.

213
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,611
I mustn’t let my guard down.

214
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,822
To Takumi, I’m nothing
but a convenient woman

215
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,659
who will sleep with him
when he wants to do it.

216
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,495
It’s one thing to get involved
once or twice,

217
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,497
but this is the third time.

218
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,082
If I don’t put a stop to this,

219
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:57,836
this pathetic relationship
may continue on.

220
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,798
If I’m gonna end this,
I’ve gotta do it now,

221
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,218
before it’s too late.

222
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,345
I just have to tell him
to never come here again.

223
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,058
But…

224
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,936
am I able to say such a thing?

225
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,288
I can’t say it.

226
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,416
Why are you drinking on your own?

227
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,750
Give me some too.

228
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,796
I know he’s not that great a guy.

229
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,222
So why can’t I… end it?

230
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,602
Oh, welcome home, Nobu.

231
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,237
Don’t!

232
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,530
What are you watching?

233
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,490
Porn videos. I’m studying.

234
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,410
Cut it out. Not at a time like this.
Are you doing it to make fun of me?

235
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,706
I can’t take it anymore.

236
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,707
Take what?

237
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,464
What’s the matter?

238
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,883
Nothing! It’s none of your business!

239
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:31,472
Um, sorry. Please leave me alone.

240
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,784
Shin.

241
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,037
A man and a woman are
simply opposing creatures

242
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,747
driven toward each other by lust.

243
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,210
Can they be connected by love?

244
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,762
Sorry, I don’t know either.

245
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:21,730
The truth is, I’m just a girl
who wanted to get close

246
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,441
to Trapnest’s Takumi outta curiosity.

247
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,945
I’m not as pure as Nana thinks.

248
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:31,824
And I’m sure I’m different
from the ideal girl Nobu pictures me as.

249
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,788
But Takumi understands me…
me who's helplessly empty.

250
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,417
And I do too.

251
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:46,005
I know Takumi is a pathetic man.

252
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,215
Nana…

253
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,592
It’s strange.

254
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,596
He lived in a world
farthest away from mine.

255
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,229
But only Takumi…

256
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,190
will forgive me for who I am,

257
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,444
as if he was the sole accomplice
to my actions.

258
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,707
Thanks for your concerns about everything.

259
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,626
Takumi came by last night,

260
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,295
and says he’ll be with me
all day tomorrow,

261
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,630
until the end of his break.

262
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,884
But I have work. I should have
taken the day off.

263
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,928
What time do you think
you can make it home, Nana?

264
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,138
With the live concert coming up,

265
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,515
I don’t wanna get in the way
of your practice,

266
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,852
so I won’t be dropping by
the studio. Good luck.

267
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:46,315
Say hi to everyone for me. Hachiko.

268
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,404
Trapnest’s time off came to an end,

269
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,448
but Nana didn’t come home.

270
00:17:55,074 --> 00:18:00,829
I simply assumed she was with Ren.

271
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,458
I wanted to at least drop
by the studio and see Nana.

272
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:09,296
But I didn’t because I didn’t have
the guts to see Nobu.

273
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,177
As usual, Takumi didn’t send me
a single email.

274
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,347
But surprisingly, I accepted that
with an open mind,

275
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,724
casually thinking he’ll eventually come
to see me again.

276
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:27,439
I couldn’t tell if that was
a feeling of trust or resignation.

277
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,984
Misato!

278
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:37,741
Thank you for coming all
the way out to pick me up, Ms. Komatsu.

279
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,993
It’s not a problem. And call me Hachiko.

280
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,454
That’s such a cute nickname.

281
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,040
We still have time before the concert,

282
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,543
so why don’t we go home first
so you can leave your bags?

283
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,002
I’ll carry one.

284
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,546
Thank you so much.

285
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,799
Is it really okay to stay
at your place again?

286
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,969
Mm-hmm. You can stay
for as many nights as you wish.

287
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,887
It’s summer vacation,
so you have free time, don’t you?

288
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,805
Yes.

289
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:04,726
To be honest, I would love to spend all
of my summer vacation here,

290
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,104
but I couldn’t possibly impose
on you for a full month.

291
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,689
That’s totally okay with me!

292
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,315
Then spend
your whole summer vacation here!

293
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,525
Or rather, I want you to stay!

294
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,111
Are you sure? I’m thrilled!

295
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,863
I’m just as glad about it.

296
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,240
-Nana’s staying with Ren…
-A train will be arriving on track one.

297
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,366
and shows no sign of returning.

298
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,660
-I was feeling all lonely living alone.
-Please stay inside the yellow line.

299
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,578
TRAIN IS COMING

300
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,292
You know, I still can’t get
over the excitement

301
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,128
after learning that Nana and Ren
are all lovey-dovey.

302
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:36,884
I carelessly blurted it out.
I assumed you would already know.

303
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:40,721
But I did secretly find out
when they were back in my hometown

304
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,890
that the two were living together.

305
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,143
I’ve been wondering what had happened
between them after that,

306
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,811
so this news is such a relief to me.

307
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,980
Please don’t tell anyone, okay?

308
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:53,734
Rest assured.
Please have faith in me, Ms. Hachiko.

309
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,991
The concert starts at seven, right?

310
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:04,286
I can’t wait to see the band members.

311
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,455
I wonder if they’re still rehearsing.

312
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,249
Actually, I haven’t seen them for a week.

313
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,961
But I thought you visited the studio
every day to see them practice.

314
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,755
Well, yeah, but…

315
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,840
I didn’t wanna bother them
so close to their live performance.

316
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,051
I see. You’re right.

317
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,637
Let’s hope that BLAST’s
professional debut becomes a reality.

318
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,096
Mm-hmm.

319
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:30,896
If I were to see Nobu today,
what expression should I make?

320
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:40,489
Nobu may never smile for me again.

321
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:45,369
That thought almost made me cry.

322
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:55,212
That other night, when Nana sang
that song that Nobu wrote,

323
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,090
she was wishing for something
as she sang it with such passion…

324
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:02,761
so her voice would reach me.

325
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,432
Right now, I realize what she was wishing.
