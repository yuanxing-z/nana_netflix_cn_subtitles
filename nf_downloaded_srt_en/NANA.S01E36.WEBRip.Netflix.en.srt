1
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:08,174
I shouldn’t have gotten a cell phone.

2
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:14,222
I know I’m the one who’s staying out
without telling her,

3
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,475
but Hachi didn’t even email me once.

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,895
That made her look more selfish,
and it irritated me.

5
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,734
I don’t want the strength of our bonds

6
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:29,988
to be tested by some communication device.

7
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,882

CHECKING FOR MESSAGES

9
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,541
CHECKING FOR MESSAGES

10
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,500
NO NEW MESSAGES

11
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,671
&lrm;NO NEW MESSAGES

12
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,432
I haven’t been home
for the past nine days.

13
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:25,353
The more time passes,
the harder it becomes for me to go home.

14
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,650
But I can’t continue living here.

15
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,198
What am I gonna do?

16
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:56,551
How does Hachi spend her time
all alone in that room?

17
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,179
Trapnest’s recording schedule

18
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,556
was extended past
what was originally planned,

19
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,435
and the band members were
all stuck inside together.

20
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:09,981
It was clear that Hachi
was lonely every day.

21
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:16,321
I couldn’t imagine that self-centered guy
contacting her much.

22
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:21,075
But I couldn’t feel any sympathy for her.

23
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,245
This is the life that Hachi chose.

24
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,874
Good morning!

25
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:32,086
You sure are up early, Takumi.
Did you get some rest?

26
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,422
No. I’m about to take a nap now.

27
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,258
Is that so?
You’ve been working hard, haven’t you?

28
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,426
How is Reira doing?

29
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,261
She’s sleeping well.

30
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:44,349
It seems that the medicine the doctor
prescribed for her is working.

31
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,559
Sleeping pills?
Maybe I should get some, too.

32
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,312
You can’t sleep either, Takumi?

33
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,690
I may be able to sleep
if you came to my room.

34
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,193
I’m not going!

35
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,986
How lonely.

36
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,114
I can’t take it anymore…
this ascetic life.

37
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,993
Then we have to be sure
and get this finished today.

38
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,704
Right. Our schedule’s been
really messed up.

39
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,456
Take’s in tears.

40
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,793
I’m sure your fiancée’s also
in tears from loneliness.

41
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,128
You know, that’s really not the case.

42
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,923
She sends me several emails a day,
and she says stuff like

43
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,841
"I knitted socks."

44
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,302
-She seems to be having fun.
-Socks?

45
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,721
She‘s thinking way, way ahead.

46
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,556
The baby’s not due until May of next year.

47
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,684
Oh, for the baby!

48
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,018
But why is it that

49
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,146
women don’t want to talk
about the real important things

50
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,692
but want to report unimportant stuff?

51
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:40,113
Don’t think of it as unimportant.
Please just remember to reply, okay?

52
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,699
I am. I write things like,

53
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,867
"Make a pair for Daddy, too."

54
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,077
Really?

55
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,787
But what if she really knits me a pair?

56
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,164
An identical pair to the kid’s?
That'd be embarrassing.

57
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,084
You’ll have to wear them.
It would be a sight not to be missed.

58
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,795
I was hoping

59
00:04:55,878 --> 00:05:01,342
Hachi would be so lonely
that she’d be longing for me.

60
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,347
Nana Osaki? Yeah, I remember.
The rabbits, right?

61
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,850
-Huh? The rabbits?
-Oh, hey! Don’t film this!

62
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,643
Is this gonna air on TV?

63
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,646
No, it’s for a magazine article.
Don’t worry.

64
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,358
I don’t wanna get involved.
Did Osaki do something?

65
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,012
When we were in fifth grade,

66
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,432
the rabbits in the rabbit cage
were found slaughtered one morning.

67
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,978
Everyone accused Osaki

68
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:58,024
because you'd expect something like that
from a gloomy kid like her.

69
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,578
Ms. Osaki was pretty,
so she stood out in junior high,

70
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,914
but she was so anti-social.
People hated her for that.

71
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,171
She was bullied?

72
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,799
I’m not too sure about that,
but I did hear rumors

73
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,552
that she got angry and beat up
a senior who harassed her.

74
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,932
Osaki’s the girl
who got kicked out of school

75
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,017
when they found out that
she was selling her body, right?

76
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,602
What did she do this time?

77
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,781
So, as you can see,

78
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:50,827
it was almost like investigating
a criminal’s past.

79
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,830
She’s the best, that Nana Osaki!

80
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,332
There is so much to write about her.

81
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,501
But I am so exhausted.

82
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,004
Why do I, a photographer,
have to go after stories like this?

83
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,965
We’re short of staff!

84
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,509
Can I go home for the day?

85
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,178
Ren Honjo’s still locked up
in the studio, right?

86
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:13,516
Yeah. Why are they taking ten days
to record just a couple of songs?

87
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,810
Are they having some issues?

88
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:19,021
Chief, it appears that Trapnest
has finished recording.

89
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,316
The band members have started going home.

90
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,526
Kurata!

91
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,238
I’ll have an article ready
and reserve a big space for you.

92
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,615
I’m counting on you.
Go get a shot of the two.

93
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,042
How do you like the new song,
Director Matsuo, Producer Kawano?

94
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,962
I like it. It’s full of energy

95
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,088
-and a little sexiness!
-Great!

96
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,298
That was more than satisfactory!

97
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,843
Then please let us record it right away.

98
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,637
And we really need you to decide
on an agency for us soon.

99
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,727
We are working on it little by little.

100
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,022
Is he really? That raccoon bastard!

101
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,233
-Raccoon!
-It’s not a laughing matter!

102
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,902
Yeah, that name suits that man, all right.

103
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,195
Are you drunk already?

104
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,447
There’s no use trying anymore for this.

105
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,242
Shin, are you at all serious
about doing this?

106
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,787
You’ve gotta realize that

107
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,625
the company’s not about to invest
in a risky new band.

108
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:25,379
They say Gaia’s not about to invest money
in an old-fashioned punk band like ours.

109
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,344
What do you mean?

110
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,346
Who said that?

111
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,389
I am really sorry.

112
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,307
RESTAURANT YAZAWA

113
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,352
I’m sorry it’s not going anywhere,
all due to my lack of ability.

114
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,896
It’s not your fault, Mr. Kawano.

115
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,898
Our band just doesn’t have what it takes.

116
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:48,110
No, your band is not the problem.

117
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,948
Due to the recession,
Gaia is reluctant to promote new bands.

118
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:57,328
This is a tough time for bands in general.

119
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:03,167
But Trapnest’s album has sold
almost three million copies.

120
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,670
Well, I guess a big part of their success
lies with their vocalist Reira.

121
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:09,340
She is attractive enough
to ride the diva boom.

122
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,176
I’m worthless unless I sing.

123
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,723
But the same goes for your vocalist, Nana.

124
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,560
I’m not about to give up, Yasu.

125
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,815
We’re not giving up that easily either.

126
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,527
Then will you give me a bit more time?

127
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,821
Our temporary contract is
for three months, right?

128
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,284
We signed the contract
because we trust you, Mr. Kawano.

129
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,952
We’ll keep our promise.

130
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,996
Really? Thank you.

131
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,331
I should be thanking you.

132
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,209
I appreciate that you put
this much heart into this.

133
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,755
But you can’t do business on heart alone.

134
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:59,807
But I have no desire to turn music
into a heartless business.

135
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,811
In our band, we have people
like Nana and Shin

136
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:08,065
who have had the misfortune
of not being loved by those around them.

137
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,775
I don’t want them thinking

138
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:14,572
this world is nothing
but money and greed after all.

139
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,285
But I’m sure there will be
many more situations in the future

140
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,996
when they will be forced
to think that way.

141
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,124
So it would be so encouraging
to have someone like you

142
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:29,337
who will support our band
with passion and love.

143
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,132
Is it too much to ask?

144
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,304
The burden you carry
on your shoulders seems too greater.

145
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:44,226
Let me carry half of it.
Don’t try to carry all that you can.

146
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,604
If both your hands are full,

147
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,231
you won’t be able to take action
when you need to.

148
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,192
Here.

149
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,488
I guess you’re right.

150
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,765
Are you still drinking, Nobu?

151
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,851
How could I not drink?
Who cares about the recession?

152
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,354
It feels like I’ve been laid off.

153
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,981
Have Hachi comfort you.

154
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,197
I can’t blame it on the recession.

155
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,201
I just need to write songs that
will convince the guys at Gaia.

156
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,663
Give me that!

157
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,670
Say, did something happen
between you and Hachi, Nobu?

158
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,923
Nobody talks about Hachi
anymore at the studio.

159
00:11:56,006 --> 00:12:00,010
Shin,
don’t you ever mention that name again.

160
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,639
Even Nobu has a thing or two
he would rather not talk about.

161
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,317
By the way, why did you buy
this acoustic guitar?

162
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,654
No real reason. I’m going out.

163
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:23,367
Must be nice. The little boy has
many older women to comfort him,

164
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,202
even one who would buy him a guitar.

165
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,829
I bought it on my own.

166
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,123
But you bought it with the money
you got from women, right?

167
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,458
It’s the same thing.

168
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,876
Nana…

169
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,712
When you get everything
you want so easily,

170
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,089
you lose that hungry spirit within you.

171
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,341
"There’s no use trying"?

172
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,887
If you have the time to play
your acoustic guitar,

173
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,555
practice the bass.

174
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,810
I shouldn’t have to be lectured
by some vocalist

175
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,395
who can’t even stop smoking.

176
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,063
-What?
-Ah, Nana!

177
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,650
Same goes for you, Nana.
Where did you get your new guitar?

178
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,820
It’s not something
you could buy with your pay.

179
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,990
And it’s unsuitable for someone
like you who can hardly play it.

180
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,783
I borrowed it from Ren!

181
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,452
Then what about those clothes?

182
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:10,164
They're all from Misato and Ren, right?

183
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,792
Nana!

184
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,711
What’s wrong with that?

185
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,254
Don’t compare me with someone
like you who sells his body!

186
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,672
Don’t be provoked!

187
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,966
I’m the one
who doesn’t wanna be compared with you.

188
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,928
I receive what’s appropriate
for my efforts.

189
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,223
But Nana, all you’re doing is cuddling up
to Ren’s kindness.

190
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,432
Shin!

191
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,031
That guy…
Is he going through a rebellious phase?

192
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,785
Wh-- Why are you taking your clothes off?

193
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,250
Damn it!

194
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,964
Is it wrong?

195
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,927
Is it wrong to accept kindness?

196
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,388
No, there’s nothing wrong about that.

197
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:12,226
Don’t worry about it, okay?
Shin’s only trying to justify himself.

198
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:16,188
I think you should let Ren spoil you more.

199
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,024
Don’t let some stupid pride
force you into a corner.

200
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,037
REN

201
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:34,832
Hello.

202
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:38,294
Oh, Nobu. Sorry to call you at this hour.

203
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,171
-Were you asleep?
-No, I’m still up.

204
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,798
-Things going well?
-Yeah.

205
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,592
Are you sure about that?

206
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:48,304
There’s no way you don’t know
about Hachiko, right?

207
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,348
Yeah. But…

208
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,935
I guess it can’t be helped.

209
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,314
Honestly, there’s nothing I can do
for her right now…

210
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,067
So you’re finally able
to face the reality.

211
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,070
Try to understand the trouble your folks
went through to raise you, okay?

212
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,781
Yes, I’m sorry.

213
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,826
You’re being too obedient.
You’re no fun to tease.

214
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:16,332
By the way, Nana’s at my place right now.

215
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,835
Huh? She’s at your place?

216
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,046
I was getting worried
because I can’t reach her on her cell

217
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,049
-and she hasn’t replied to my emails.
-Huh?

218
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:28,052
Really? Maybe she’s forgotten
to switch it on.

219
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:32,431
After band practice, Nana, Shin
and I were drinking together.

220
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,229
Actually, Ren…
Nana’s been acting a bit strange lately.

221
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:49,073
She’s always been short-tempered,
but her mood swings are intense.

222
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,366
Even just now,
she got into an argument with Shin.

223
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,742
She got all panicky and started crying.

224
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,704
Also, she told me not to tell anyone,
but at one point,

225
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,750
she said she sometimes can’t remember
what she’s been doing.

226
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:08,008
Yeah, she has been acting a bit strange.

227
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,970
Nana…

228
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,639
Nana, get up!

229
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,559
At least put your clothes on.

230
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,521
Shut up.

231
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,314
If you’re a man, come at me.

232
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,400
Show me what you’re made of.

233
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,527
Ren said he’s coming to pick you up.

234
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,196
If he sees you like that,
he’ll get the wrong idea.

235
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,656
He should be here any time now.

236
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,824
He doesn’t have to come!

237
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,742
Why not? Please, get dressed!

238
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,745
What if he gets followed by a mosquito?
That’ll be trouble.

239
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,206
A mosquito?

240
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:42,501
I mean, the paparazzi are after us!
Naoki was saying so.

241
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,211
So there’s no doubt about it.

242
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,797
But I’m sure it’s fine.

243
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,716
If it weren’t, I doubt Ren would say
he’d come pick you up.

244
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,386
He has no idea the damage
a scandal can cause!

245
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,638
He kept calling me to his place

246
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,473
without saying a word
about being targeted.

247
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,103
He only thinks of himself.

248
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,189
I don’t wanna draw attention
as "Ren’s girl."

249
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,445
Return the guitar to him.

250
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,447
And tell him that
I won’t be seeing him for a while.

251
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,741
Is your pride that important to you?

252
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,996
Ren needs you, you know.

253
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,499
You’re the one who’s only thinking
about yourself.

254
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,188
A moon that’s not quite full.

255
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,233
That’s how I feel when I’m with Ren.

256
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,904
No matter how deeply we love each other,

257
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:55,783
I’ll bet there’s no one
who can really make me feel complete.

258
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:02,623
But when I’m on stage… I become complete.

259
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:08,295
I must protect it, my dream,

260
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,631
no matter what I end up sacrificing.

261
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,678
I wonder if Hachi’s sleeping.

262
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,473
What time is it now?

263
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,019
Where’s my cell phone?

264
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,481
It’s annoying to have
but so inconvenient not to have.

265
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,447
Takumi might be there. But it is my home.

266
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,200
There’s no need for me to hold back.

267
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,266
It’s quiet.

268
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,436
Isn’t she here?

269
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,523
Maybe she’s sleeping with Takumi.

270
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,527
But she may be alone.

271
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,241
Whatever, I don’t know what to think.

272
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,245
TO NANA

273
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,917
TO NANA

274
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,425
TO NANA

275
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,221
What is this?

276
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:45,976
What’s she up to?

277
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,649
Hachi!

278
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,373
Hachiko, are you here?

279
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,550
&lrm;FROM NANA
&lrm;TO NANA

280
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,866
You know, Hachi…

281
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:48,163
Back then,
when you kept losing yourself in love…

282
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:54,336
maybe you too were struggling
to feel complete, just like me.

283
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:59,132
If so, then I can understand
some of those feelings you had.

284
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,051
It’s just that I couldn’t back then.

285
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:06,014
Does the new life you protected
at all costs

286
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,934
make you feel complete, even now?
