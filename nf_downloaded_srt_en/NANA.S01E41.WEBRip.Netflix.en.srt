1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,881
In those hectic days
when we barely had time to sleep,

2
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:13,304
I had not realized the flaw in my plan.

3
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:41,332
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

4
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,076
So, what do you wanna do
when we get there?

5
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,869
Let's try some real Italian food first.

6
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,122
I looked up some stores we can go to.

7
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,414
Hey, isn’t he from Trapnest?

8
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,541
-Huh? Whom?
-Ren?

9
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,542
No, the long-haired one.

10
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,709
Really? Where?

11
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,503
So where’s Ren?

12
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,758
I’m sick of eating bread
for breakfast every day.

13
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,176
I want some miso soup.

14
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,179
Oh, I found
this great Japanese restaurant.

15
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:22,058
-Wanna go there tonight?
-I want some of Nana’s salty miso soup!

16
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,394
Ren, keep your voice down.

17
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,772
Ren, you’re better off forgetting
about women like that.

18
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,857
"Women like that"?

19
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,818
While we’re on the subject,
I’ll be blunt with you.

20
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,862
I believe Nana is the type of girl
she’s rumored to be,

21
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,531
and you’re really being fooled by her.

22
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,574
If she loved you,

23
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,867
she’d be more careful
about the salt content in her cooking--

24
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,453
Take, let me go back to Japan earlier too.

25
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,705
That’s not fair only Takumi got to go.

26
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:48,334
No, you still have your photoshoot.
Besides, he had his reasons.

27
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,211
What? Takumi’s returning early?

28
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,714
He’s already left. Yesterday.

29
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,800
What’s with that?
Why didn’t he say anything about it?

30
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,929
-He should’ve arrived in Japan by now.
-He’s so cold…

31
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,517
Mom, I’m off to check in at the hotel.

32
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,228
If Mr. Ichinose’s coming to see us
tomorrow anyway,

33
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,564
he should just stay over.

34
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:13,234
But he’ll be arriving pretty late,
so he didn’t wanna inconvenience anyone.

35
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,947
He shouldn’t be so formal.
He’s gonna be family.

36
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,866
They’re seeing each other
for the first time in two weeks.

37
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,993
Of course they want some time alone.

38
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,828
Oh, I guess you’re right.

39
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,748
I’m sure looking forward to tomorrow.

40
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:30,293
Talking with him over the phone,
Takumi seems like a really nice person.

41
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,628
Huh? When did you talk to him?

42
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:36,007
I answered the phone
when he called from overseas.

43
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,301
Dad is so critical
when it comes to celebrities,

44
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,345
saying they’re as bad as the yakuza,

45
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:43,431
but even he was praising Takumi
on his manners.

46
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,351
Really? But Takumi is like a yakuza.

47
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,268
HE’S GOT YOU FOOLED.

48
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,186
Is that so?

49
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,313
If he actually was one,
he’d take over the world.

50
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,649
He’s so cutthroat.

51
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,526
Then God must’ve given him musical talent

52
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,321
to keep him on the right path in life.

53
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,494
The world of entertainment
seems glamorous,

54
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,412
but I’m sure it’s pretty difficult.

55
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:10,333
It will be your job to create a home
where he can relax.

56
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,794
So stop slacking off and do your best.

57
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,420
Mm-hmm.

58
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,882
By the way, how’s Nana doing?
Have you been keeping in touch?

59
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:21,678
No. I heard that Nana's cell phone broke,

60
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,223
so I haven’t been able
to call or email her.

61
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,683
And she hasn’t called me.

62
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,186
I see. That’s a bit worrisome, isn’t it?

63
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,481
Yeah. But from what my other friends
are telling me,

64
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,608
she seems to be in extremely
high spirits and working hard.

65
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,567
Extremely?

66
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,403
That’s my Nana!

67
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,446
She’s a tough girl!

68
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:48,955
I was so frantic to give Hachi the chance
to see me out there singing.

69
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:54,168
It never occurred to me to ask
how she was doing…

70
00:04:55,044 --> 00:05:00,091
about her child or about Takumi…
Honestly speaking, I didn’t want to know.

71
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,885
Although that was just me being jealous.

72
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:08,599
You haven’t touched your breakfast.
Are you feeling sick?

73
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,934
No…

74
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,146
Hey, Mari. I wonder
if Takumi met up with Stella.

75
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,232
Huh? I-- I don’t know.

76
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,070
But we’ve been so busy,
I doubt he had time to sleep around.

77
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,782
He raced through his schedule
for his fiancée after all.

78
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,868
-That’s awful.
-Huh?

79
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:30,371
Well, that might be okay for his fiancée,

80
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:34,083
but Stella has been Takumi’s lover
for a lot longer!

81
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,960
Ah, is that so?

82
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:41,466
She might’ve even been secretly dreaming
of marrying Takumi someday.

83
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,301
I feel sorry for Stella.

84
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,097
YOU'VE GOT MAIL

85
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,599
SUBJECT: IT’S ME, SHIN

86
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,437
-You sure are amazing, Reira.
-Huh?

87
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,982
To be able to see things from
so many different perspectives like that.

88
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,527
I was only thinking of the feelings
of Takumi’s fiancée.

89
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,780
Someone who can sing songs

90
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,240
that captivates the general public
sure is different.

91
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,535
You overestimate me, Mari.

92
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,787
Huh?

93
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,166
It’s just a matter of whose feelings
I can empathize with more.

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,754
I’m a selfish person
who only thinks of herself.

95
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,340
I have no idea how
Stella really feels at all.

96
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,807
How are you, Reira?

97
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,434
Are you getting enough rest in London?

98
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:38,022
Right now, I’m recording
at a training camp

99
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,399
deep in the mountains up north.

100
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,194
The recording is coming along well,

101
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:47,448
but we’re forced to run in the morning
and do the cleaning.

102
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,617
What’s that all about?

103
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:55,331
But in these five days,
perhaps because of this healthy lifestyle,

104
00:06:55,414 --> 00:07:00,086
I think I’ve grown a little taller.
Or maybe I’m just imagining it.

105
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,548
It’s salty!

106
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,424
Huh?

107
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,094
You’re the one who wanted miso soup!

108
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,971
Stop complaining and eat it!

109
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:14,392
Why is everything you cook
always so salty?

110
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,728
Misato should’ve come along
to this training camp.

111
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,022
Then she could’ve cooked for us.

112
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,275
No, we couldn’t do that.

113
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:26,279
She should quit school
and become our manager.

114
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,239
-Great idea!
-She’s very considerate too.

115
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,782
That’s true.

116
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,703
In any case,
I wanted a cute girl for a manager.

117
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,163
Yasu!

118
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,873
Are you not satisfied with me?

119
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,624
-Not satisfied at all.
-Not satisfied at all.

120
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,211
What was that?

121
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,466
Ginpei! You’re a man, so talk like one!

122
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,759
And we don’t need two baldies!

123
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,138
Who are you to say?
You’re a girl, so talk like one!

124
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:56,434
And my head’s not bald. It’s just shaved!

125
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,978
Well, I’m not naturally bald either…

126
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,898
Oh! Smells good in here.

127
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,651
Ah, Matsuo! If you haven’t eaten,
would you care to join us?

128
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,695
-I’ll pass.
-Eat it.

129
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,531
I’ve decided to eat with the staff
when it’s Nana’s turn to cook.

130
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:14,118
That’s why your wife left you, Matsuo.

131
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:18,122
Anyway, Mr. Kawano will be arriving soon,

132
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,042
so we’re gonna skip practice
and have a meeting instead.

133
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,128
Come to the studio’s conference room
when you’re done eating.

134
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,756
Man, it’s cold! What’s with this weather?

135
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,382
This is crazy. It’s still September.

136
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,551
What happened to global warming?

137
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,638
-What’s global warming?
-Read the newspaper.

138
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:37,225
These facilities belong to Gaia,
and the equipment is all spectacular,

139
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,644
but there’s nothing
but forest and lakes around us,

140
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,604
which makes life inconvenient.

141
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,399
But at least for now,
the press hasn’t come after us,

142
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,236
so it’s a lot more peaceful
than being in Tokyo.

143
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:53,407
Above all, I appreciate the clean air
and seeing the sky full of stars at night.

144
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,244
For some reason,
whenever I see something that sparkles,

145
00:08:56,327 --> 00:09:00,915
I’m reminded of you, Reira. I wonder why.

146
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,459
I really don’t know.

147
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,961
Guerrilla gigs?

148
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,923
Yeah. Five locations in Tokyo,
starting on the tenth of next month.

149
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:12,718
Shinjuku, Yoyogi, Ikebukuro,
Ueno, and Shibuya.

150
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,430
We’ll be setting up a special stage
in spots with lots of pedestrian traffic.

151
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,266
Yay! Live performances!

152
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,768
But won’t we get in trouble
with the police?

153
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:24,188
No. Of course we’ve obtained permits
for the locations.

154
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,898
We’re just not announcing to the public

155
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,525
that we’ll be having
these live performances.

156
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,861
I’m sure you’re sick of dealing
with the cops, right, leader?

157
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,615
So, our audience is
the street pedestrians.

158
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,868
But we’ll have
20 part-time paid applauders.

159
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,453
We don’t need your hired applauders!

160
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,664
Oh no, you must have applauders.

161
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,291
Japanese crowds are
so hard to get fired up.

162
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,792
Stop talking, you!

163
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,588
Just think of them as promoters
for when a new store opens.

164
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,590
-It’s just a way to draw customers.
-Oh…

165
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,759
Oh my! So you’ll obediently listen
to what Yasu says.

166
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,762
You aren’t actually together, are you?

167
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,016
-I’ll kill you, buzzcut!
-Oh, bring it on!

168
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,892
-Wow, nice muscles, Ginpei!
-S-- Sorry…

169
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,894
That’s okay, as long as you understand.

170
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:08,899
Come to think of it,
you may not know being overseas, Reira,

171
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,278
but the coverage in the magazines
has gotten worse,

172
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,156
and now even Yasu’s being targeted.

173
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,616
Just like with Nana,

174
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,701
they’re writing garbage
about whatever they can.

175
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,661
His past and everything.

176
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,497
They’ve made him out to be
the character he looks like.

177
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,499
He’s got quite a presence now.

178
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:31,589
I don’t know if it’s
because they haven’t found out

179
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,924
or they’re purposely hiding it,

180
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,177
but nothing’s been written about
the fact that you two were lovers.

181
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,970
So don’t worry.

182
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,902
Hey Ren, has Naoki told you about Yasu?

183
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,779
What’s that baldy up to?

184
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,156
I guess Search published
an exposé about him.

185
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,326
Naoki says there are rumors about it
all over the internet.

186
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,535
An exposé about what?

187
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,536
All kinds of things.

188
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,664
Apparently, he hit a Search reporter
to protect his vocalist

189
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,751
and was taken in
for questioning by the police.

190
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,878
Then other magazines started saying

191
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:15,383
that Nana and Yasu are actually dating
and things like that.

192
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:21,222
That’s just not possible. It’s all lies.

193
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,142
In addition, Search also wrote
that Yasu’s not a real lawyer

194
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,395
since he doesn’t have a license
to practice law.

195
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,356
-Isn’t that horrible?
-That is horrible.

196
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,942
-Um, Reira…
-Oh, thank you.

197
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,737
You know, I’ve been concerned
about those rumors too.

198
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,696
Huh?

199
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,784
Is it possible Mr. Takagi never served
as a law apprentice for a firm?

200
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,995
What’s a law apprentice?

201
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,498
It would be equivalent
to a medical intern.

202
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,667
After passing the bar exam,

203
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,961
you must serve as a law apprentice
for a year and a half

204
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,422
before you can become a real lawyer.

205
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,090
You really know a lot, Mari!

206
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,717
-More like you don’t know anything.
-What about you?

207
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,637
Well, it’s not exactly common knowledge.

208
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,556
I’m a law school graduate.

209
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,727
That’s amazing! You’re not just wearing
those glasses for show.

210
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,396
No, there’s nothing amazing about it.

211
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,772
And these glasses are just for show.

212
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,066
Then what are you doing
being Reira’s babysitter?

213
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,068
What do you mean, babysitter?

214
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,278
You know, like changing your diapers…

215
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,863
She doesn’t!

216
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,323
-Enough about me.
-No.

217
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:27,288
I wanna know more about you.
Are you free tonight?

218
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:30,166
Why do all our members try
to seduce every woman they see?

219
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,208
Are you Italian?

220
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:36,589
Anyway, so that’s why
Yasu said he was a trainee.

221
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,133
So I guess he’s in the midst
of his so-called apprenticeship.

222
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,677
But it’s been a year and a half
since he graduated,

223
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,928
so he could already be a lawyer!

224
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,306
No, once you become an apprentice,

225
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,142
you must go where you’ve been assigned.

226
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,395
He would’ve had no say
as to where he’d be assigned.

227
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,815
If he was devoted to the band,
it would’ve been difficult.

228
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:59,069
His mentor probably
saw Mr. Takagi’s abilities

229
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,948
and hired him through the office
and had him do only deskwork.

230
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,950
-Mari, can you come here?
-Yes!

231
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,622
Mr. Takagi probably couldn’t give up
his dreams for the band.

232
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,081
The fact that he hit that reporter

233
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,542
shows just how much he cares
for his band members.

234
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,085
No matter what the public says,

235
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,005
I think Reira’s boyfriend
is a wonderful man.

236
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,175
Don’t pay attention to the rumors,
and keep your spirits high.

237
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,552
-Mari?
-Yes!

238
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,888
Boyfriend?

239
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:29,350
What does that mean?
Wasn’t Yasu’s dream to be a lawyer?

240
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,191
It’s always been secrets and lies.

241
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:40,569
Since the old days,
I never knew what he was thinking.

242
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,114
I have no intention of making
a living on music,

243
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,325
and I don’t plan on
ever leaving this town.

244
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,160
So I guess there’s nothing
we can do about it.

245
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,916
If the band is that important to him,

246
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,169
was that just an excuse
to break up with me?

247
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:02,967
No, he didn’t go that far
for the sake of the band.

248
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,636
This may be a problem.

249
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:10,015
I could no longer sacrifice
that much for Nana.

250
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,773
I wonder why.
I still love her like I always have.

251
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,321
Hey, Ren. If I died,
would you die with me?

252
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:31,996
When did I become such a cold person?

253
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:41,755
Reira. If you said that
you were lonely now,

254
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,634
I’d fly to London in a heartbeat.
I’d go anywhere.

255
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:50,681
If I could warm your heart and body
even a little,

256
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,474
then it would be worth it.

257
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,810
The way I say that,

258
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,939
you may get the wrong idea
and think I’m a kind person.

259
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,650
The truth is simply that
I don’t have anything right now

260
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,987
that is as important to me as you.

261
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,699
I don’t know about tomorrow, though…

262
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,452
Sorry for being so selfish.

263
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,794
That’s different
from being a cold person, Ren.

264
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:25,674
The longer we live,
the more weight we carry on our shoulders,

265
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,762
and it gets harder to do what you want…

266
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:34,850
That’s why you need someone
to carry that load with you.

267
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,189
Don’t you think you and your girlfriend
could do that for each other?

268
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,831
Welcome home!
You must be exhausted from work!

269
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,375
I’m really exhausted.

270
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:07,883
Souvenirs!

271
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,052
So many!

272
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,513
-Which do you want?
-Just one out of seven?

273
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,768
-How about this one!
-You’ve got a great nose.

274
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,603
-You picked the diamond…
-Huh?

275
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,605
…earrings. That’s a good choice.

276
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,857
-No, I’d rather have this one!
-That’s some tea.

277
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,110
-What about this?
-A pearl necklace.

278
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,028
Wristwatch. Shoes.

279
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,115
A handbag. Cashmere scarf.

280
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,701
Where’s the ring?

281
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:37,454
Well, that’s different from a souvenir.
You already have it.

282
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,497
Where?

283
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,249
Your left pocket.

284
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,015
A magic trick?

285
00:16:56,098 --> 00:17:00,936
It’s that tendency to let your guard down
that lets men trick you.

286
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:06,275
I do have a list of priorities
that I cannot change.

287
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,569
First is work.

288
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,280
That makes up for more than
ninety percent of my brain.

289
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,490
Everything else doesn’t matter as much.

290
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:18,996
But I’d say my girl comes second.
I need her so I can relax.

291
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,250
I won’t be able to care for you too much,
but I won’t let you have a hard life.

292
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,919
Okay.

293
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,756
As long as I’m your number one
second priority.

294
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,468
I’m sorry, but you’re number two
in my second priority.

295
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,385
Huh?

296
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,388
Maybe this souvenir would best suit
my number one woman.

297
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,306
Shoes?

298
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,058
They wouldn’t fit you anyway.

299
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,267
She must be petite.

300
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,438
Sachiko…

301
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,857
Is it you again?

302
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:51,487
You’ve already given her a name?
And what a traditional name.

303
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,405
Well, whatever name’s fine with me.

304
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,742
Here! Then these are
for our little Sachiko.

305
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,292
They’re so cute! Thank you, Daddy!

306
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,086
So many!

307
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:11,173
But doesn’t that sound awkward?
Sachiko Ichinose.

308
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,424
It’s like a tongue twister.

309
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,718
Stop it with that ominous name.

310
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,136
You gave her that name!

311
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:22,184
Reira. The reason I bought
a laptop computer was

312
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:27,648
because I wanted to spend all the money
I got from you quickly,

313
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:31,193
but I didn’t wanna spend it
only on myself.

314
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,780
I bought the acoustic guitar
for the same reason,

315
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,824
but I could never become
romantic enough to sing

316
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,201
where my voice would not reach you.

317
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:40,744
So from now on,

318
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,123
I’ll send you an email from time to time
like I’m doing now.

319
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,916
If you feel up to it, please write back.

320
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,210
Goodbye for now.

321
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,921
We had fine weather today,

322
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,841
so I’m sure the sky will be
full of stars tonight.

323
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,891
Oh, Mr. Illegal Lawyer.

324
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,228
What are you working on,
hiding in the dark?

325
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,814
Same goes for you.

326
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,566
You shouldn’t be walking outside alone
in the middle of the night.

327
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,483
It’s dangerous.

328
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,486
It’s all because that raccoon told us
about the guerrilla live performances.

329
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,615
-I got too excited to sleep.
-Sleep while you have the chance.

330
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,452
Once we get back to Tokyo,
we’ll be really busy promoting our music.

331
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,001
-Wanna sleep with me?
-Sure. Why not.

332
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:35,591
-That was a joke.
-That wasn’t funny.

333
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,680
Because you’re in love with me.

334
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,182
You’re right.

335
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,102
Now that I’ve laid all my cards
on the table,

336
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,104
there’s no point in denying it.

337
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,564
Was I too obvious?

338
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,028
You’re damn right, baldy.

339
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,071
What in the world are you up to?

340
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,657
I’m not really up to anything,

341
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,035
so you stop worrying
and just focus on singing.

342
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,621
But Yasu…

343
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:11,668
ever since Ren and I broke up
back home two and a half years ago,

344
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:18,050
I‘ve felt closer to you than to Ren.

345
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,345
Even when I’m with Ren,
I’m still feeling a bit lonely.

346
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:25,557
He and I can no longer
become one like we used to.

347
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,976
Why is that?

348
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:33,065
I still love Ren like I always have.

349
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:38,320
Mai, Yui, Sumire, Akane.

350
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,989
Names using only
a single kanji character are best!

351
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,532
And it looks prettier with the last name,

352
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,369
which uses three kanji characters.
Like Takumi.

353
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,370
What’s wrong with Sachiko?

354
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,538
No way! Come on and help me think!

355
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,124
But I’m already kind of attached to it.

356
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,252
It’s decided. The name’s Sachiko!

357
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:57,631
Hey, Hachi.
With stardust spread all across it,

358
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:00,259
the night sky looks
awfully bright tonight too.

359
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:05,097
Even now, when I see something sparkling,

360
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,600
it reminds me of Ren.
