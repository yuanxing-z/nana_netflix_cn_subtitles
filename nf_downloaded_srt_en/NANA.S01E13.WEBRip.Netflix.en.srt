1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,588
The biggest reason I chose that job
was because,

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,258
unlike working in sales,
I get weekends off.

3
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:12,721
I felt that I would then be able
to spend more time with Shoji,

4
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:17,100
who’s busy with school
and work during the week.

00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,825
RAMEN SEIROKU

7
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:00,620
Kyosuke, have you ever been
unfaithful to your partner?

8
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,375
You did it? With Sachiko?

9
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,879
The defendant shall
just answer the question!

10
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,506
The defendant would be you.

11
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,385
-I’ve never been unfaithful to my partner.
-You liar!

12
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,470
During our senior year,

13
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:21,224
you’re the dumbass who fooled around
with several girls at the same time!

14
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,351
-Was I?
-Don’t play stupid with me!

15
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,896
I know it all! There’s that college girl
you met at the club,

16
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,649
the nurse from the hospital when you had
your motorcycle accident,

17
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,484
and Tamura's sister from class six.

18
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,905
You have a pretty good memory.
I didn’t know you were that jealous.

19
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,323
Anyway!

20
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,366
There’s no way a cruel man

21
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,160
with such a past record
would not cheat on his partner!

22
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,745
Are you that desperate
for a partner in crime?

23
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,540
But that really brings back memories.

24
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,460
Those days were the peak of my popularity.

25
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,588
Lately, my popularity
with the girls has plummeted.

26
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,132
Then if you were popular,
you’d fool around, right?

27
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,051
I wouldn’t.

28
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,554
Why not? Because you’re afraid of Junko?

29
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,847
Well sure, it’s natural to be
afraid of Junko,

30
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:01,973
being a former delinquent in school
and all.

31
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,476
Because I’m afraid of losing Junko.

32
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,816
Check please.

33
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,026
Right away.

34
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,287
There’s a woman there
who totally pisses me off!

35
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,664
What do you call them?
You know, like, a spinster?

36
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,751
"Ms. Komatsu, you can’t even
make a decent cup of tea.

37
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,920
You’ll never make a good wife."

38
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,880
She’s the one who can’t find a husband,

39
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,924
that thirty-eight year old bitch,
Sakagami!

40
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,845
What’s wrong, Shoji?
You seem to be under the weather today.

41
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,806
Well, you know, I wish you
wouldn’t say stuff like "bitch".

42
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,185
Did you pick that up
from your foul-mouthed roommate?

43
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,478
But she really pisses me off!

44
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,315
It’s only a small publishing company,
but they have a ton of little side jobs!

45
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,569
They talk down to me,
I’ve gotta work overtime,

46
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,821
and I even had to come in
both days this weekend

47
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,615
because of the approaching deadline!

48
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:04,035
So much for weekends off.
I hate it. I wanna quit!

49
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,331
-Then quit.
-Don’t say it so casually!

50
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,833
You just said you wanted to quit.

51
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:16,172
But it’s not that easy. I haven’t even
worked there for a week yet,

52
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,009
and if I quit, there’s no guarantee that
I’d find another job right away.

53
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,845
And I can’t make a living unless I work.

54
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,722
Then you have no choice.

55
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,272
Well, it’s easy for you, Shoji.

56
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,401
Bottom line,
you’re a carefree college student,

57
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,069
and your parents pay for your basic needs.

58
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,488
If you hadn’t bought that computer
and kept track of your expenses,

59
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,573
you’d have no problem getting by, right?

60
00:04:56,254 --> 00:05:00,717
That was awful. Why did I say that?

61
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,595
Why can’t I be a nice, cute girl
in front of Shoji?

62
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:22,530
Unless he asks me to go home with him,
we won’t be able to make up.

63
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,913
Wanna come up?
Nana’s probably still at work.

64
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,000
No, it’s okay. You have to get up
early tomorrow for work, right?

65
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,003
Good night.

66
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:43,468
You’re mad at me,
so don’t try to force a smile.

67
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:48,723
Unless you’re direct with me,
how am I supposed to apologize?

68
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,354
Ms. Komatsu! How long is it taking
you to sort those postcards?

69
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,232
You really are slow!

70
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,359
Yes, sorry, Ms. Sakagami.

71
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,986
-In a way,
-Oh, why did

72
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,321
-this woman is a breath of fresh air
-the editor-in-chief hire

73
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,239
-the way she’s direct about everything
-such a useless girl?

74
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,532
although she still pisses me off.

75
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,245
The publishing company
I started working at is located

76
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,498
on a floor of a multi-tenant building
in the heart of the big city.

77
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,833
It's a small company that publishes
information magazines targeted

78
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,878
at young men and women
in their late teens and early twenties.

79
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:19,796
THE BEST 20 PLACES FOR
THE GOLDEN WEEK HOLIDAY!

80
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,090
Since I’m the same age group
as those targeted,

81
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:26,010
I came into this job thinking this
would be the perfect workplace for me.

82
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,888
But my job here consists of…

83
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:33,142
cleaning, serving tea, making copies,

84
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,604
delivering manuscripts, and so on…

85
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,110
None of this has anything
to do with the magazine itself,

86
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:48,157
just simple jobs that anyone can do,
and so much of it with no end in sight.

87
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:53,454
Ow, my feet hurt…
From tomorrow, I’m wearing lower heels.

88
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,419
-Editor-in-chief.
-Yes?

89
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,172
Here are the illustration manuscripts
from Mr. Noguchi.

90
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,926
Oh, thank you for your hard work.
Nana, how about a drink tonight?

91
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,094
Not a good idea!

92
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,346
The editor-in-chief is on the verge
of sexual harassment.

93
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,265
-The company employees are…
-Could you speak a little slower, please?

94
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,808
-…mostly older men past their prime.
-A little slower, please?

95
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,892
Nana, dear,

96
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,769
make me some coffee.

97
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,063
The few young ones are all like that guy.

98
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,066
At least comb your hair,
25-year-old Honda!

99
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,361
Ms. Komatsu!
Can’t you even make copies properly?

100
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,405
They’re all crooked!

101
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,323
I’m so sorry.

102
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,785
And the trains are so crowded.

103
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,621
What in the world is there
to look forward to

104
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,373
as I make my way to the workplace daily?

105
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,334
I’m so exhausted!

106
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:51,679
Why is there no elevator
in this seven story building?

107
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,183
Why? Why is it?

108
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,187
This must be why the rent is so cheap.

109
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,231
I’m home.

110
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,858
Hachiko!

111
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,861
Wh-- What is it? Your smile is too bright.

112
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,488
A live show! A live show!

113
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,823
They had an opening
in an upcoming event at Shimokita,

114
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,825
and they’re letting us
fill that spot and play.

115
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,995
-Huh?
-It’s for thirty minutes on May 5th!

116
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,298
Yay!

117
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,886
Don’t cry, Hachiko!
We’re gonna party today!

118
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,898
Hey, did you hear?
On May 5th, Children’s Day,

119
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:47,735
they’re gonna decorate the kids’ meals
with little carp kites.

120
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,029
Look at this. Cute, don’t you think?

121
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:54,116
Wow, this is really well made!
This is great.

122
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,786
-You want it?
-Yeah, sort of.

123
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,371
But you can’t have it.

124
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:01,123
I got it as a birthday present
from our boss.

125
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,626
Huh? It was your birthday?

126
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,462
Why didn’t you tell me?

127
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,549
No, not yet.
My birthday is on Children’s Day.

128
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,760
I told him it’s a shame
I won’t see them being served

129
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,596
because I won’t be working that day,

130
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,807
so then he gave this to me,
saying it’s a birthday present.

131
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,727
Oh, so that’s why.
I’m off in the evening that day,

132
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,145
so why don’t we spend the evening
together to celebrate?

133
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,272
Really?

134
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,569
What do you want for your present?
A chimaki, maybe?

135
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,778
I love chimakis.

136
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,157
Shoji, your cell phone.

137
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,326
Oh, sorry. I forgot to turn it off.

138
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,828
You should answer it.

139
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,621
-Ah, but…
-It’s from your girlfriend, right?

140
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,791
If you keep ignoring her calls,
she’s gonna become suspicious.

141
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:47,044
-I’ll step outside.
-Ah, then I’ll go out…

142
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:54,760
Damn, what am I doing? Pathetic.

143
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,972
-Hello?
-Oh, Shoji! You’re awake!

144
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,142
Guess what? The date for Nana's
band's first live show has been decided!

145
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:04,520
Ah, r-- really? That’s great.

146
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,690
It’s at 8:00 p.m. on May 5th.
Can you make it?

147
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,317
The 5th?

148
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,071
Sorry. I can’t make it on the 5th.

149
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,700
-What? You can’t? You have work?
-Yeah.

150
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,703
No way. Can’t you do something about it?

151
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,290
No. You know, it gets extra busy
on national holidays, so I’ve gotta work.

152
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,542
I’m really sorry.
We’ll do it some other time.

153
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,502
Sure.

154
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,642
On Children’s Day,
let’s scatter some beans.

155
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,019
You’re thinking
of the Setsubun festivities, Shoji.

156
00:10:57,114 --> 00:11:00,326
Stop looking. It’s so distracting.

157
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,037
Well, I was thinking,
"Wow, what a good looking woman,"

158
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,163
then I noticed it was you.

159
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,625
Huh? You won’t get anything
from seducing me.

160
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,420
I don’t really need anything,
as long as I have you by my side.

161
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,547
What’s gotten into you?
Do you have food poisoning?

162
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,550
I forgot to tell you,
the eggs in the fridge are old.

163
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:20,930
You know, I’ve been wondering
why people have a change of heart.

164
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,725
But the more I think about that,
the tougher it is to take.

165
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,976
Oh?

166
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:31,232
I had forgotten all about Tamura
from class six until Shoji brought her up.

167
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,691
Tamura from class six?

168
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,320
Unlike the other girls I went out with,
I really loved her.

169
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,698
And it really hurt when I found out
she was only playing with me.

170
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:44,703
What bittersweet teen years.

171
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:49,166
You know, there’s nothing
we can do about Shoji.

172
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,253
What do you mean?
Don’t tell me, he did it with Sachiko?

173
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:55,131
You know, I didn’t think
he was the kind of guy

174
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,592
who was capable of cheating,
due to multiple reasons.

175
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,470
As far as I know, neither did I!

176
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,475
He’s not just fooling around either.
He’s serious about the other girl.

177
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,603
He’s seriously fallen in love
with Sachiko.

178
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,897
He’s no longer able
to think rationally or morally.

179
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,108
There’s nothing we can do.

180
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,625
What’s he gonna do about Nana?

181
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:37,923
I wonder. It’s not as if anything’s
happened for him to dislike Nana.

182
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,383
I’m sure he continues
to have feelings for her.

183
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,178
But he’s gotta make things clear,

184
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,513
or else he’ll end up hurting
both Nana and Sachiko.

185
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,975
You’re right, but that’s
based on your values.

186
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:51,937
I don’t know much about Sachiko,
but what would be best for Nana?

187
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,023
As long as she doesn’t find out about it,

188
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,609
Shoji may be necessary for her,
even if he is seeing someone else.

189
00:12:56,692 --> 00:13:00,654
Over time, Shoji’s feelings
for the other girl may cool.

190
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,032
You can’t expect me
to agree with that logic.

191
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,659
But just imagine for a minute.

192
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,246
Imagine Nana
after she gets ditched by Shoji.

193
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:14,877
Frightening, don’t you think?
She might even slit her wrists.

194
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,670
I just hope Shoji is doing
everything possible

195
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,255
to make sure Nana doesn’t find out!

196
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,885
Can’t be sure. It’s really frightening.

197
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,482
Hello, Nana here. Oh, Jun-chan?

198
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,026
It’s been a while. What’s up?

199
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,154
Ah, Nana?

200
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,031
You’re in the middle of work now,
aren’t you? Is it okay to talk?

201
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:48,118
Mm-hmm. No problem. We met our deadline,
so things are pretty peaceful here.

202
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,997
Hey, about that email you sent me
regarding your roommate’s live show.

203
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,833
Yeah, right! It’s next Saturday!
Can you come?

204
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,629
Mm-hmm. I’ll go with Kyosuke.
So tell me how to get there.

205
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,422
The three of us can go together then.

206
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,342
Huh? The three of us? What about Shoji?

207
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,052
Shoji said he had to work
and couldn’t come.

208
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:06,971
Huh?

209
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:11,141
Hey, Jun-chan, don’t you think Shoji
has been acting a little weird lately?

210
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,727
-What do you mean?
-I just have this feeling.

211
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,563
You think so?
He hasn’t really changed at all.

212
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,983
But I get the feeling
he’s been avoiding me.

213
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,402
That’s not true! You’re imagining it!

214
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,321
But it seems that Shoji’s
seriously growing tired of me.

215
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,658
Well, you know, you mustn’t
make excuses about how busy you are.

216
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,369
As hard as it may be,
try making the time to see him.

217
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,329
Show him that you really care,
and I’m sure he’ll reconsider

218
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,499
his feelings for…
I mean his attitude towards you!

219
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,251
Oh, I see. You’re right.

220
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,004
I’ll show him that I care.
Yeah, I’ll do my best.

221
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,590
Thanks, I’ll call you later.

222
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,509
Come on, Ms. Sakagami.
What are you doing here wasting time?

223
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,553
Please get back to work.

224
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:55,644
Why do I have to take the fall for Shoji?
This is all wrong.

225
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,106
But what else can I do?

226
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,150
Thank you very much!

227
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,821
Shoji!

228
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,531
I came.

229
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,034
Sorry for coming here without any notice.

230
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,871
Nice to meet you. I’m the bassist, Shin.

231
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,875
Hachi wouldn’t shut up
about wanting to see you.

232
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,336
We came all the way here,
so you’re paying.

233
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,756
Um… Then allow me
to show you to your table.

234
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,007
Please do.

235
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,718
This way, please.

236
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,803
No way. I’d rather sit
at that window seat over there.

237
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,348
Why should it matter where we sit?

238
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,516
Welcome.

239
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,145
Huh? Where’d Shoji go?

240
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,483
I’m sure he went
to get us water or something.

241
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,193
Would you sit down already?

242
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,697
Your boyfriend is so cool, Nana.
And that uniform really suits him.

243
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,950
Doesn’t it? Though he’s kinda lame
when he speaks.

244
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,744
Now how many times have I heard that?

245
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,085
-What are you doing, Ms. Kawamura?
-Excuse me! I’m very sorry!

246
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,461
You could hurt yourself
if you pick it up with your bare hands.

247
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,463
I’ll go get a broom.

248
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,344
You’re bleeding! Are you okay?

249
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,975
Your handkerchief. I’m sorry.

250
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,059
Don’t worry about it.

251
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,186
-You can have it, so never mind.
-But…

252
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,231
What’s important now is
for you to treat that cut.

253
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,570
-I’m sorry!
-Huh?

254
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:32,241
Ms. Kawamura. Why are you crying?
Get a hold of yourself!

255
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,702
I’ll take care of things here.
You go to the back.

256
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,540
I’m terribly sorry
for all the trouble, miss.

257
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,084
No, please do not worry about me.

258
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,964
You’re so kind, Hachiko.
My impression of you has just improved.

259
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:51,760
Actually, I used to work at
a family restaurant like this in the past,

260
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,096
so when I see something like that,
it’s like seeing myself.

261
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,725
Oh. I can just see you making
far worse blunders.

262
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,478
Huh? What’s that supposed to mean?
Come on!

263
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,442
I’ve run away again.

264
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,569
What am I doing hiding like this?

265
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,655
I should’ve predicted this much.

266
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,743
Well, Nana might not realize,
but Sachiko could very well realize.

267
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,453
Nana can be pretty loud, too.

268
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,290
Please, let Nana be nice and quiet.

269
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:31,467
I really am pathetic. I could just puke
thinking about how detestable a guy I am.

270
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:51,695
Sachiko.

271
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,996
Let’s put an end to this, Shoji.

272
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,167
She’s cute, kind,
and such a wonderful girlfriend.

273
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,211
What just happened between you and her?

274
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:11,298
It’s all right.
I doubt she has caught onto anything.

275
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,596
Let’s put an end to this,
before she ends up getting hurt.

276
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,810
I’m sorry, Shoji.

277
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:28,649
If I hadn’t gone after you like I did,
none of this would’ve happened.

278
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,026
That’s not true.

279
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:36,824
But at this rate,
I’ll just be more of a bother to you.

280
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:37,866
That’s not true!

281
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:42,371
This’ll continue hurting me, too.

282
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,546
No one can end up happy in this situation.

283
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:55,050
Make sure you take good care of her.

284
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,818
I guess it’s kinda hard to eat
with a pierced lip.

285
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,820
Serves you right.

286
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:18,824
Shin, you seem to be getting
more piercings by the day.

287
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,576
Now you even have one there.

288
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,162
What have you done to your beautiful face?

289
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,957
-I’m sure kissing is harder with that.
-No, I had no problem with that.

290
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,837
Shin! Who’d you kiss? Was it Nobu?

291
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,174
-Huh? Is Nobu into that sort of stuff?
-Is he?

292
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,719
Ah, no. But I thought this guy might be.

293
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,429
I’m straight.

294
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:45,309
Hey, Shin. Do you plan to continue living
at Nobu’s place like you are now?

295
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:49,229
Actually, I haven’t been
to Nobu’s place much lately.

296
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,939
I don’t wanna be a burden.

297
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,359
-So you’ve returned home.
-Nope.

298
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,819
Then where are you staying?

299
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,321
At some women's places.

300
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,280
What!

301
00:19:58,906 --> 00:19:59,781
I move from place to place.

302
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,241
No way!

303
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:07,247
I’m still fifteen, I look like this,
and I still can’t find a steady job,

304
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,918
but I realized that if I live this way,
I won’t have any money problems.

305
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,630
Surprisingly, life can be pretty easy.

306
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,844
Shin… You’re a natural born bastard.

307
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:21,970
Bastard?

308
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,348
One day, you’re gonna get killed
by a woman.

309
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,725
Shin, I'm so sad.

310
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,477
Nana.

311
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,234
Come on, Shoji. Where had you run off to?

312
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,778
Do you have any plans after this?

313
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,948
No. I have four straight days off
from work starting tomorrow.

314
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,324
I'll wait for you to get off work.

315
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,994
-You don’t have to wait.
-Huh?

316
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:52,292
Can I go to your place later?
I need to talk to you about something.

317
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:59,591
If Nana hadn’t been with me that evening,

318
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:03,845
I probably would’ve thrown myself
into Tama River and sunk to the bottom.

319
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:08,100
I really think so.
