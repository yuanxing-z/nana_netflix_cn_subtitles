1
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:22,897
MAY BLAST MAKE THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEBUT

2
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:27,485
Back then, the one thing I had plenty of
was my countless number of wishes.

3
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,764
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

4
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,375
It’s July 7th?

5
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,751
SATURDAY, JULY 7TH 2001

6
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,002
A bad omen.

7
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,337
What is?

8
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,549
Actually, Nana hasn’t talked like that
lately, has she?

9
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,760
Before, she would blame everything
on the Demon Lord.

10
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:19,097
Perhaps she’s becoming more of an adult.

11
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,766
Let's hope so.

12
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,355
Kyosuke, do you want your eggs
sunny-side up or scrambled?

13
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,857
Sunny-side up.

14
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,110
Come to think of it…

15
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:35,989
Nana doesn’t come by our place
as often as she used to.

16
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,325
I don’t think I’ve seen her
in quite some time.

17
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,368
How’s she doing?

18
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,621
Oh, right. You couldn’t make it
to her roommate’s live concert either

19
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,498
because of work.

20
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:50,211
Well, she’s doing okay,
but there was something odd about her.

21
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:54,257
Yeah. You mean that scent
of a new guy in her life?

22
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,801
Although she denies it.

23
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,428
Has she found a job?

24
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,429
Ouch!

25
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:03,016
Judging by the fact
she’s said nothing about it, I doubt it.

26
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:07,103
She said something about wanting
to work in sales at a fancy shop.

27
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,688
But it’s been at least a month

28
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,648
since she was fired
from her previous job, right?

29
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,941
How’s she getting by?

30
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,109
She seems to be managing.

31
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:17,155
She said she’s been taking on
temporary jobs to get by.

32
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:20,116
But it’s not like there are
that many temporary jobs.

33
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,369
Hmm… She’s registered at a temp agency

34
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,121
specializing in demonstrators.

35
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,873
What exactly does a demonstrator do?

36
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:33,421
This is the new product, Raffine Beer.
Please give it a try.

37
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,673
This demonstrator takes part

38
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,343
in campaigns to promote food items
which are new to the market.

39
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,552
You’ll find them in the food section
of department stores,

40
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,805
preparing anything
from sausages to sliced fruits.

41
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,516
In other words, I’m a food salesgirl
offering food samples.

42
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,727
I get called for a sales blitz
that lasts for two, three days.

43
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,773
I get paid over ten thousand yen a day,

44
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:55,235
so I took the job to help me out
with living expenses for the time being.

45
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,072
But it’s actually a lot more fun
than I expected.

46
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,908
Anything involving food
would seem fun to you, Hachiko.

47
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,620
N-- No way! That’s not why.

48
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,539
How should I put it…
the interaction with the customers…

49
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,668
-Hey, Nobu, about this part…
-Listen to me!

50
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,086
What is it?

51
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:18,007
I’m convinced that working in sales
really suits me.

52
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,177
For instance, I’m really good at that
"free smile" deal.

53
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,806
Then you should find a job
at a fast food joint.

54
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,308
If the uniform’s cute, then I’d love that.

55
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,518
This latest gig from the beer company

56
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,019
requires me to wear
a campaign girl-type mini-skirt outfit,

57
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,688
which I look pretty good in.

58
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,315
I would’ve loved to see that.

59
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,943
That old pervert’s saying something.

60
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,118
The Milky Way’s not visible.

61
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,038
I was so looking forward to seeing it.

62
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,126
Hey, Nobu!

63
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:57,297
About meeting up tomorrow,
Yasu’s asking if we could meet there.

64
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:01,843
Sure! Since I’ll get off work just in time
for the opening anyway!

65
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:02,802
Tomorrow…

66
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,097
July 8th?

67
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,183
He says it’s okay!

68
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,687
That’s right. Tomorrow is
Trapnest’s last performance.

69
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,064
-The three of you are going, right?
-Mm-hmm.

70
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,776
Those VIP seats.
Are they in a special section?

71
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,529
Not really. They’re center seats
on the second floor balcony.

72
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,948
I hear you get a great view,

73
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,283
but since you’re surrounded by those
associated with the band

74
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,035
and journalists,
the section is pretty much dead.

75
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,787
What? That sounds so boring.

76
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,499
But we’re not exactly fans,

77
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,169
so I’m rather thankful that I won’t
be sitting between screaming voices.

78
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,921
You should’ve had Ren
get you a seat too, Hachi.

79
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,799
It might not be too late.

80
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,718
Why don’t I ask him?

81
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,429
No, I already saw them back home,
so it's fine.

82
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,307
Besides, I’m a bit busy tomorrow anyway.

83
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,100
You’ve got it wrong!

84
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,519
You have to write a wish
and hang it from a bamboo branch.

85
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,229
A wish?

86
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,689
Do you seriously not know?

87
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,024
-What?
-What’s the matter?

88
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:01,861
Well, Shin says he’s never seen
Tanabata decorations.

89
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,946
Can you believe it? He just asked me,
"What is a tanzaku?"

90
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,282
Like I asked before, what kind of life
have you been living?

91
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,409
Didn’t you do that kind of stuff
in kindergarten?

92
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,787
I wanna write a wish on a tanzaku too.

93
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,413
Then wanna come over to write some?

94
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,165
We still have some tanzaku left.

95
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,458
All right!

96
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,715
She made Tanabata decorations?

97
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,426
I told her not to, since it’s
embarrassing at her age, but…

98
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,391
&lrm;Just a sec…

99
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,602
All right.

100
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,938
Defeat Trapnest?

101
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,900
Nobu, that’s not a wish!
That’s a resolution!

102
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,360
Yeah, I guess.

103
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:49,075
I’ll write a wish for Nobu.
"I want to become taller. Nobu."

104
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,118
None of your business!

105
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,495
Besides, you’re shorter than me!

106
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,247
But I’m still growing.

107
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,499
Sorry to say this,
but I’ll surpass your height in no time.

108
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,876
I think I’ll wish for that.

109
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,129
I wish that we can get an air conditioner.

110
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,798
I wish that I get back the car I sold.

111
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,217
I want a veranda
where I can decorate bamboo branches.

112
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,177
I want money.

113
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,472
You guys, can’t you write down
some real dreams?

114
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,641
But this room is so damn hot!

115
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:14,684
Indeed.

116
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,853
My dreams will wither in this heat.

117
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,440
Nana! The tanzakus are being blown away.

118
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:44,380
That day, the clear skies of Tokyo
filled up with clouds in the evening,

119
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,592
and we never got to see the Milky Way.

120
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:51,762
However, we ended up staying up
all night chatting.

121
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:04,108
I already knew that wishing alone
won’t make dreams come true,

122
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,110
but I did feel that each time
a dream came true,

123
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,654
I would become that much happier.

124
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,531
MAY HACHIKO FIND A BOYFRIEND
(LONG-HAIRED) NANA

125
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,368
Today, we will once again bring you
a wide range of special melodies,

126
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,162
from the latest hit songs
to nostalgic songs from the past.

127
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,748
We will kick off with a video clip
of a group who will be performing

128
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:23,211
the finale to their first nationwide tour
tonight. Trapnest.

129
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,804
Once the tour is over…

130
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,225
I’ll come to see you.

131
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,810
When I do, would you mind
cooking for me again?

132
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,820
He will come. He won’t come.

133
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,698
He will come. He won’t come.

134
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,616
He will come.

135
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,118
He won’t come.

136
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:01,082
Oh, no! Nobody in today’s age uses
flowers to make predictions anymore!

137
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,750
I may be insane!

138
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,753
I shouldn’t have to use flowers!
I know the answer!

139
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:06,921
There’s no way he’s coming.

140
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:11,133
He didn’t even reply to my email.
He’s probably forgotten all about me.

141
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,345
But just in case…

142
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,349
Even if Takumi doesn’t come,
I’m sure Ren will come.

143
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:22,228
There’s no big difference in cooking
for three people or four people.

144
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,149
I don’t know what time they’ll show up,

145
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,652
so it has to be food that’s tasty
even after it’s cooled.

146
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,865
These tomatoes are really delicious.

147
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,826
Where did you get them from?

148
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,167
This many veggies? Thank you, Jun-chan.

149
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,712
The two of us can’t eat all this.

150
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,380
They just arrived,
so they’re really fresh.

151
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,298
Today's my lucky day!

152
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,843
Well then, thank you so much, Jun-chan.

153
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,511
Come by again.

154
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,972
-Kyosuke said he’d love to see you.
-Mm-hmm.

155
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,684
But look at all the stuff you bought.
Are you expecting someone?

156
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,061
N-- Not really. N-- No one’s coming.

157
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,028
It’s probably for the best
for him not to come.

158
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,614
Then I can easily give up on him.

159
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,659
Besides, if Takumi comes over,

160
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,454
I will have to explain everything to Nana.

161
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,664
There’s no way I could hide
things any longer.

162
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:29,211
But if that happens, there’d
no longer be a reason to hide things.

163
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,843
If Takumi is the kind of guy who would
come to see me as he promised,

164
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:39,430
I would feel less guilty
about the situation.

165
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,366
Hey, Hachiko! Who’s gonna eat all this?

166
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,326
There’s easily enough food
for five people!

167
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,704
I guess I got a bit carried away.

168
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,582
But I figured he'd be hungry
after the live performance.

169
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,542
I wonder what time Ren will be here.

170
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:12,380
Huh? He’s coming? Did he say he is?

171
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:18,386
What? I don’t know,
but I assumed he’d be coming. Isn’t he?

172
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:22,056
I doubt he is.
He never made any such promise.

173
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,227
-Why not?
-What do you mean, why not?

174
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,853
His tour ends today,

175
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,898
so wouldn’t he come to see you
first thing after the concert’s over?

176
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,400
He hasn’t seen you in a month!

177
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,776
He will definitely come!

178
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,946
But tonight they’re partying until late
to celebrate the end of the tour.

179
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,198
It’s not likely
he’ll be able to come here.

180
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,951
Partying until late…

181
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,661
I see.

182
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,497
But he may come after that.

183
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,210
No. If Ren comes over and stays the night,
you’d feel obligated to be hospitable.

184
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,629
So we decided that from now on,
whenever we wanna meet,

185
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:56,257
I’ll go to Ren’s place.

186
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,385
He’s not gonna suddenly show up
late at night without my knowledge.

187
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,764
No way. I was faintly hoping that…

188
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,642
Hoping that Ren would come to see Nana,
and Takumi would tag along

189
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:09,311
with his casual
"Maybe I’ll come along too" attitude.

190
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,355
H-- Hey…

191
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,275
I don’t care even if it would be
a casual spur of the moment decision.

192
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,610
I just hoped he would come.

193
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,280
Don’t let it get you down.

194
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,782
If you wanna see Ren,
I’ll ask him to drop by sometime.

195
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,077
He did say he has free time
starting tomorrow.

196
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,247
Oh, if you’d like I’ll have him
invite Takumi again, and…

197
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,708
No, it’s all right! Don’t worry about me!

198
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,625
B-- But…

199
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:38,215
Well, anyway, I don’t think
he’ll be able to come today.

200
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,302
I’m sorry, considering
all the food you prepared.

201
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,554
It’s okay. It really is.
Really, don’t worry about it.

202
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,931
I’ll just put everything in the fridge.
It’ll last a few days.

203
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,518
What am I doing?
I got carried away all by myself again.

204
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,521
Hey, wait! I’m hungry.

205
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,815
Do you mind if I eat what I can now?

206
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,276
Sure. Of course you can.

207
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,737
I’ll get some plates.

208
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,530
This looks really delicious.

209
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,242
Ren doesn’t know what he’s missing,
losing out on this great feast.

210
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,411
Delicious!

211
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,833
However, seeing the way
you’re acting, you actually wanted

212
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,503
to go to the final concert
with everyone tonight, didn’t you?

213
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,298
I should’ve asked Ren about it.

214
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,885
I’m really bad at noticing
that sort of stuff. Sorry.

215
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,553
That’s not true.

216
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,181
Never mind me.
I bet you wanted to go, didn’t you?

217
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,934
You can be really stubborn.

218
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,269
It’s not really about being stubborn.

219
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,187
If I saw the performance,

220
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,064
I’d end up comparing myself
and get depressed.

221
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,649
As shameful as that is…

222
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:41,278
This is great too. Looks like
we’ll be enjoying great food for a while.

223
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,325
I’m the one who’s lousy
at noticing things about others.

224
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,247
I’m sorry for forcing
those words out of you.

225
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,294
Thank you very much!

226
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:13,310
Today’s performance is now over.

227
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,146
People are asked to follow
the guidance of the staff

228
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,566
and promptly leave the premises.

229
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,035
I’m going home.

230
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,706
Huh? You’re not going?
But our pass allows us to go backstage.

231
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,332
I have work to do.

232
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,793
Never mind that. Just come for a bit.

233
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,921
Sorry. Give Ren my regards.

234
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,047
What about Reira?

235
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,511
Tell her "Good job."

236
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,637
That’s it?

237
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,431
TRAPNEST'S BACKSTAGE ROOM

238
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,058
Huh? Where’s Yasu? Isn’t he with you?

239
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,729
He left, saying he had work to do.
He sends his regards to Ren.

240
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,315
-Huh? What about me?
-No way!

241
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,651
I was really looking forward
to seeing him.

242
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,528
I guess it wasn’t mutual, Naoki.

243
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:09,700
I was also looking forward
to seeing him. So it wasn’t mutual?

244
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:10,910
This is so painful.

245
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,580
Reira, you realize it’s hard to come up
with a comeback phrase in your case.

246
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,457
It wasn’t mutual? This is so painful.

247
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,376
Not to mention there are writers
around us taking notes.

248
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,546
Take, it’s not a laughing matter.

249
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,591
Yasu asked me to tell you
that you did a good job.

250
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,345
Wow, what a pretty boy!

251
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,014
-Come play with me.
-Hey!

252
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,517
Sure, but I’m expensive.

253
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,186
One hundred thousand yen per night
for the "works".

254
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,103
Shin!

255
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,314
You’re cute too. How much?

256
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,566
Ren, save me. What’s up with this person?

257
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,319
I think I'll go home.

258
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,446
Come on. We’re partying. Come join us.

259
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,407
We’ve got a second and third party
lined up, so we’ll be at it until morning.

260
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,284
Yay! I’m coming, I’m coming.

261
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,494
Yay, come, come.

262
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,621
Yeah, I’m coming, I’m coming.

263
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,174
Gin and tonic.

264
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,177
Are you sure, Nobu?
We’re only at the second party.

265
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,220
Shouldn’t you slow down with the drinking?

266
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,014
I can’t blend in with this atmosphere
unless I’m drunk.

267
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,225
Such a pure-hearted guy!

268
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,688
I wonder why Yasu went out
with such a weird woman.

269
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,981
Weird woman?

270
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,732
The mysteries of Yasu keep building.

271
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,151
I can’t let you talk like that, Nobu.

272
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,405
How dare you talk
about our princess like that.

273
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,783
Takumi… Sorry to bother you,
but could you please autograph these?

274
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:36,120
What. What’s this? You're making me work,
even in this place?

275
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,329
Sorry.

276
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,165
I got autographs from the others
during breaks at rehearsals,

277
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,210
but you seemed busy, so I was
gonna ask you later then forgot.

278
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,838
It’s a request
from a very important sponsor.

279
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,632
Okay, okay. If it’s so important,
then you shouldn’t forget.

280
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,550
Sorry.

281
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,385
Pull yourself together, manager.

282
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,512
So you’re signing them? Good for you.

283
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,596
I’m a mature man after all.

284
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,683
You’re the one who does
the musical arrangements

285
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,435
for all the Trapnest songs, right Takumi?

286
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,436
That’s right.

287
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,273
And you also produced
your latest album, right?

288
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,190
Well, yeah.

289
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,027
So that’s why it’s
so much better than the first one.

290
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,613
Oh? You’re cute. How about
for two hundred thousand yen?

291
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,866
But you’re seriously great.

292
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,242
How do you manage to make

293
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,704
such fancy music
out of Ren’s dark, twisted songs?

294
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,956
Excuse me for writing dark, twisted songs.

295
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,499
Shochu!

296
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,794
But it’s all possible
because of Ren’s songs.

297
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,296
How do you manage
to get on everyone’s good side?

298
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,089
By the way, Takumi,

299
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,216
could you sign an autograph for me, too?

300
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,177
Sure. But do you have autograph paper?

301
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,596
No, I don’t. Just give me one of those.

302
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,015
But these are for our important sponsors.

303
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,141
What do I care?

304
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,601
He’s just like Nana.

305
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,561
To whom?

306
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,771
-Hachiko.
-Huh?

307
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,355
Ren, if it’s for Hachi,

308
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,649
why not do the favor of having him
write out her full name?

309
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,526
What is her full name?

310
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,489
Hachi… Where have I heard that before?

311
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,199
You met her a while ago, Takumi.

312
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:58,035
At the mahjong tournament. Nana Komatsu.

313
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,037
Oh, yes, Nana.

314
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,543
She may no longer want
an autograph from me.

315
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,670
Huh? But she said she wanted one.

316
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,964
-When?
-The day of the mahjong game.

317
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,469
Then there’s no need.
We did it the next day.

318
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,721
Where did Take go?

319
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,684
Wait. What do you mean, "You did it"?

320
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,646
What? You want me to explain it to you?

321
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,981
She’s my girl’s best friend.

322
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,067
It’s one thing to fool around with women,
but you’ve gone too far.

323
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,278
-Know your limits.
-Don’t get all worked up.

324
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:37,157
It’s not as if I forced myself onto her.
She agreed to it.

325
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,743
She was wagging her tail
looking all pleased.

326
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,460
Hey, you!

327
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,630
Take, it’s nothing.
They’re just fooling around.

328
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,343
If you wanna fight, let’s take it outside.

329
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,638
It’s a party for all the tour staff.
Don’t spoil it.

330
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,563
-Nobu…
-I’m going home.

331
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,815
You’re going home?

332
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,026
Takumi…

333
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,615
Good job.

334
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,662
The autographs!

335
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,122
Are you all right, Takumi?

336
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,710
-Shin is so awesome!
-Don’t laugh, Reira.

337
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,795
Don’t get all upset, Takumi.
You’re the one at fault.

338
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,840
I was just telling the truth!
What’s wrong with that?

339
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,552
You think you did
absolutely nothing wrong?

340
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,971
I’m going home too.

341
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,348
You can’t leave, Takumi.
We’ve still got the third party to go to.

342
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,308
Continue without me.

343
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,934
Takumi, the autographs…

344
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,353
I’ll redo them tomorrow
and send them to you.

345
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,814
Thanks to this, I just remembered
something important that I must do.

346
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,566
What? A woman thing again?

347
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,775
When you see Nobu, tell him that

348
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,320
he cannot reach my level
even in a hundred years.

349
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,698
He doesn’t have the guts
to make a woman his, so stop fussing.

350
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,534
I agree with the second half.

351
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,703
I’ll give him the message.

352
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,557
What is it at this time of night?

353
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,269
Hey, Hachi…

354
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,002
Hey, Nana…

355
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,966
Why are having a dream come true
and achieving happiness

356
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,260
two different things?

357
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,974
I still don’t get it, even now.

358
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,517
MAY HACHIKO FIND A BOYFRIEND
(LONG-HAIRED) NANA
