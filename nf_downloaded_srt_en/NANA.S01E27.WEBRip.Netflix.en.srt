1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,091
No matter how close we are as friends

2
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,343
and no matter how often I commute
to the studio to see them practice,

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,722
bottom line, I am not a member of BLAST.

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,143
As I’m repeatedly reminded of that fact,

5
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:20,854
I’m left with the feeling of fear
rather than loneliness.

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,900
Why am I so weak?

7
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:55,180
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

8
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,147
Shin, where did you forget your keys?

9
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,899
Ding-dong!

10
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,903
Wh-- What?

11
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,574
-Where’s the woman?
-Woman?

12
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,201
Good for you. You haven’t brought one in.

13
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,786
Mind your own business.

14
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,747
I brought you breakfast, darling.

15
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,875
What the hell are you up to?

16
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,796
How do you expect me to eat all this,
first thing in the morning?

17
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,214
I have cake, too.

18
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,173
I don’t get it!

19
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,300
Here!

20
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,801
And a whole cake at that?

21
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,479
It’s gotten cold,
so I’ll warm it up in the microwave, okay?

22
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,564
What is all this?

23
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,235
You still don’t get it? Boy, you’re slow.

24
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,158
Wait, Nobu. Where are you going?

25
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,285
To thank her. Or actually, to apologize.

26
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,163
But it’s still six in the morning!

27
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,831
Hachiko will still be asleep.

28
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,085
You’re right.

29
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,339
She said she’s working today,

30
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,840
so if you wanna apologize,
do it in the evening.

31
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,927
Besides, you’ve got work
during the day too, right?

32
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,763
Anyway, let’s eat.

33
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,806
Today is Sunday the 29th of July.

34
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,434
The weather will be pleasant
across the country.

35
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,727
However, in the Tokyo region,

36
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,688
there will likely be strong winds
in the evening.

37
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,982
Coming up after the commercial break
is fortune-telling based on blood type.

38
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,117
You know, I’ve been thinking from before…

39
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,789
Hachi’s a really good cook.

40
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,916
You think so? I think she’s normal.

41
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,802
I'll leave the leftovers,

42
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,554
so share them with Shin
and have Yasu come over, too.

43
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,723
I’ll tell him to drop by
on his way back from work.

44
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,100
But don’t you think it would be
nicer for all of us

45
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,143
to go and see Hachi tonight?

46
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,104
We should also say hi
to Misato while we’re at it.

47
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:34,440
Do as you wish. I’ve got work tonight,

48
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,733
so I’ll have some of this cake
while I still have the chance.

49
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,111
But it would be a shame to cut it.

50
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,862
Let’s take a picture of it.

51
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,656
Took one already.

52
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:42,657
Give it to me!

53
00:04:56,337 --> 00:05:01,259
He didn’t respond to the alarm clock
or the noise I made.

54
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,013
Takumi must be really tired.

55
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,476
And still, he agreed to see me.

56
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:15,106
I’m glad, but… I’m feeling a bit guilty.

57
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,025
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU DURING
A BUSY TIME. THANKS.

58
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:17,942
I’LL EMAIL YOU.

59
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,694
I thought that for Takumi,

60
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:23,614
I was just a convenient woman
he could do it with whenever he pleased.

61
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,367
But as things stand,

62
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,495
I’m the one
who’s taking advantage of Takumi,

63
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,082
using him as a man who will hold me
whenever I feel lonely.

64
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,684
I don’t want it.

65
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,526
I said I don’t want it!

66
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,321
I told you, I only came here
because you gave me too much last time!

67
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:08,326
Then you can take this
as an advance payment for the next time.

68
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,273
Sorry, Take. I was asleep. Am I late?

69
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,485
I figured as much,
so I purposely told you an earlier time.

70
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,237
So not to worry.

71
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,905
I brought you a change of clothes.

72
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,031
Oh, thanks.

73
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:47,990
I’ll put them here,

74
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,744
so get ready while I go
and get Reira checked out.

75
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,622
Huh? Reira stayed here, too?

76
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,210
I heard you’re not feeling well.
You have a cold?

77
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:02,130
No, no. I just got carsick.

78
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:06,092
But I’ve never known you
to have motion sickness before.

79
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,719
-Are you worried?
-Of course.

80
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:12,974
If you break down,
our entire band comes to a stop.

81
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,977
You’ll cause problems for everyone.
Don’t forget to oil the joints.

82
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,354
Don’t talk about me like I'm some object!

83
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:23,192
It's just a figure of speech.
Then I’ll drink it myself.

84
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,988
That day, my work involved
selling milk at a supermarket.

85
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,322
It’s a sweet and delicious milk…

86
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,949
-I wonder how much longer
-…produced in Hokkaido.

87
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,784
-I’ll be repeating days like this.
-Please give it a try.

88
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,869
It’s a sweet and delicious milk…

89
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,204
-Days of no progress.
-…produced in Hokkaido.

90
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,840
Huh? My keys aren’t in here.
Did Misato not go out today?

91
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,216
TO NANA KOMATSU
FROM SEIICHI AND HARUE MIZUKOSHI

92
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,594
No way! From Mr. Mizukoshi? What is it?

93
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,387
WE GOT MARRIED

94
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,849
He didn’t have to notify me about that.

95
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,853
That’s so nice. I envy them.

96
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:02,523
I wanna hurry and get married, too.
His wife is so cute.

97
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,151
He said he knew her since they were kids.

98
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,196
I want a cool childhood friend, too.

99
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,658
I don’t care if I don’t find
a rewarding job.

100
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:16,204
If I could just cook every day
for someone I love,

101
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:20,208
that'd make me so happy.

102
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,378
But marriage is unthinkable with Takumi.

103
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,256
I should hurry up and put an end
to this pathetic relationship

104
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,717
and start a real one.

105
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,178
But can a person like me find someone

106
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:35,431
who will love me for the rest of my life?

107
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,269
What if things keep going like this
and I can't find anything to live for?

108
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,981
Am I gonna grow old and die alone?

109
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,736
Welcome home, Ms. Hachiko!
Everyone’s been waiting for you!

110
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,112
-Huh?
-We’re celebrating.

111
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,532
They just got a contract
with the record company!

112
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,700
We haven’t signed it yet, though.

113
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,453
Like I said, what reason
do you have to hesitate?

114
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,413
Well… There are a number of things.

115
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,374
Hachi!

116
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,503
I’m sorry. Your cake was delicious.

117
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,381
Shin.

118
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,425
Make me your wife.

119
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,053
Hey, Shin! What are you doing?

120
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,683
Unable to play the guitar or piano,

121
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,394
I could never become a member of BLAST…

122
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:27,733
But no one can surpass the love
I feel for BLAST and their music.

123
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,363
And I swear to this for as long as I live.

124
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,998
In my opinion.
a straight-up punk band like us

125
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,500
will do better in the long run
if we take our time

126
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,296
and go around on our own for a while
building a fan base

127
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,007
rather than suddenly going big
and signing with a record company.

128
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,425
-Why?
-Why?

129
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,306
Sure, there are many artists
as good as pros

130
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,515
who haven’t signed a contract
with a major label,

131
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,809
but if you’re planning
on going pro eventually anyway,

132
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,270
why do it in such a roundabout way?

133
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,522
You have an offer on the table
from an industry leader.

134
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,524
You seem to know your stuff, Misato.

135
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,318
When it comes to going pro,

136
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,529
our queen, for one,
is feeling a sense of urgency,

137
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,780
and I had initially thought
if we’re gonna do this anyway,

138
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,741
why not go big and become pro?

139
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,826
However, after thinking it
through some more…

140
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:22,622
Come on. You don’t need to think so much!

141
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,789
I know you wanna look before you leap,

142
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,791
but we can't be paralyzed by fear.

143
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,420
However, in the world of the major labels,
everything’s driven by sales.

144
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,505
Even if you come up with a hit song,
unless you follow it up with another hit,

145
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,382
the public will be quick to desert you.

146
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,343
Once you’re left with the image
of being a one-hit wonder,

147
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,511
it’ll be extremely difficult
to make a comeback.

148
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,221
I see. In other words, you’re saying

149
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,306
it would be better
to get established first

150
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,141
by attracting fans
that will stick with you,

151
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,352
and then switch to a major label
once you’ve built that foundation.

152
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,772
That’s right.
Besides, with our current position,

153
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:51,025
we’d pretty much have to agree to
a contract that favors the record company.

154
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,276
Do you mean money?

155
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,570
No, various things.

156
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,782
But if we build a reputation,
there will be more offers to go pro,

157
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,533
and we’d be able to choose

158
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,285
the one that provides the best conditions.

159
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,454
I don’t care about the terms!

160
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,414
Let’s go pro and take
our chances from there!

161
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,749
We simply need to sell songs, right?

162
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,667
That’s right, that’s right!

163
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,794
But to be honest, in your present state,

164
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:14,131
I don’t believe you can write
several marketable songs in a row.

165
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,511
Nonsense! Sure, he can!
Like, he already has!

166
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,389
Think about it!
I’m not a big fan of punk music,

167
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,517
and frankly, I’ve never been
interested in punk music at all!

168
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,684
I only know the Sex Pistols

169
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,061
because I watched that movie,
"Sid and Nancy"!

170
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,729
And even then, I was left with the feeling

171
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,731
that I don’t really understand punk music!

172
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,734
Is that so?

173
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,238
I’m sorry.

174
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,033
But… I like the songs Nobu writes.

175
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,538
And it’s not that I’m favoring
his music because we’re friends.

176
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,665
I’ve thought so ever since
I heard his music for the first time.

177
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,916
I was totally surprised!

178
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,126
I was deeply moved!

179
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,502
It’s so cool, it gave me goose bumps.

180
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,586
There is no way you won’t sell.

181
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,089
You know… Hachi…

182
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,383
It’s okay, I understand.

183
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,094
Thank you. Don’t say another word.

184
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,096
I’m so happy I could cry.

185
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,687
But I also think you’re capable
of writing songs that will be popular.

186
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,604
Really?

187
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:14,567
With the original BLAST,
Ren wrote most of the songs,

188
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,070
so I do believe the music appealed
to only the hardcore fans.

189
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,364
But compared to Ren’s music,
Nobu’s music is closer to pop.

190
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,283
With a little work,
I think the music could gain support

191
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,784
from a wide range of listeners.

192
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:27,496
But Ren’s songs are very popular
with the general public.

193
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,416
That’s because now he’s writing songs
to suit the Trapnest style,

194
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,084
as a professional.

195
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,254
Yeah. You’re very knowledgeable, Misato.

196
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,213
I’m impressed.

197
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,466
I’m impressed with Ren.

198
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,217
He not only creates songs
to suit the band,

199
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,094
but the songs he does write
become major hits.

200
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,681
But the reason Trapnest’s songs
are so popular

201
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,808
has more to do with Takumi’s arrangements.

202
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,519
No matter what kind of song,
if it falls into Takumi’s hands,

203
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,230
he can make it fit into Trapnest’s style.

204
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,025
You know, I’ve always wondered,

205
00:12:56,108 --> 00:13:00,779
doesn’t Ren mind having Takumi
completely change the music he writes?

206
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,783
I mean, don't most bands
arrange their songs together?

207
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,203
I wouldn’t wanna be ordered
to play in a certain way.

208
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:11,540
He's listening to the opinions
of others, it seems.

209
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,918
He seems to trust his band members.

210
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,003
In the past, Takumi used
to write the songs too,

211
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,005
so it was a complete one-man band.

212
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,591
And that led to clashes,
which is why back in their amateur days,

213
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,177
the band members kept changing, right?

214
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,264
Naoki is their second drummer,
and Ren is their fourth guitarist.

215
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,225
You really know all the details.

216
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,977
Anyone would be uncomfortable
in such a band.

217
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,730
Of course, Ren knew all this
when he joined Trapnest, right?

218
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:39,235
Yeah. But Ren supported
Takumi’s beliefs from the start.

219
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,736
What’s this belief?

220
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,117
He’d say, "I’m the only one
who can create a sound

221
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,454
that would bring out the ultimate
beauty in Reira’s voice."

222
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,793
Oh, wow. I just thought
for a moment how cool that was.

223
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:56,877
Me too.

224
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,256
But didn't it make you jealous,

225
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,007
having him talk
about your girlfriend like that?

226
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,592
How do you know about that?

227
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,178
I believe there’s very little data
I don’t know

228
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,514
when it comes to anything to do
with local bands from my hometown.

229
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,183
I will stop at nothing
until I know everything. It is my belief!

230
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,143
Is that so?
But we split up a long time ago.

231
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,770
I know!

232
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,981
I had no idea.

233
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,776
Jealous? Should I be feeling jealous?

234
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,237
That’s a strong bond
we’re talking about here.

235
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,073
They could even be a couple.
It’s Takumi we’re talking about.

236
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,992
This is no time to be thinking
how cool that sounded.

237
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,705
We kinda got off subject.

238
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,290
The issue here is not about Trapnest.

239
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,125
It’s about the future of our band.

240
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,043
Oh, that’s right. I’m sorry.

241
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,254
Geez. You always change
the subject like that

242
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,089
whenever it turns to you.

243
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,593
I feel like there's something wrong
with me for not being jealous.

244
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,304
But we shouldn’t be making
any decisions about the band

245
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,430
without Nana present.

246
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,598
That’s right.

247
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,224
So, what time is Nana returning?

248
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,310
Oh, she said she’d be working,
so she might not make it.

249
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,812
No way. Nana isn’t coming?

250
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,064
I haven’t seen her for days.

251
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:03,861
Well, I did see her on stage yesterday,
but that was one-sided.

252
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:08,490
Hey, Hachi. We’re outta wine.
Will you go buy some?

253
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,035
But it’s not safe alone,
so take Nobu with you.

254
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,787
You go buy it yourself.

255
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,082
But I’m obviously under the age limit,
so they won’t sell me any.

256
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,252
It’s okay, Hachi, I’ll go alone.

257
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,378
Or rather, don’t come.

258
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,630
That’s no good.

259
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,090
It's borderline whether or not
you look old enough.

260
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,302
But Hachi’s looking sexier lately,
so she’ll be okay.

261
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,387
-Sexier?
-So go.

262
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,015
What am I gonna do?

263
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:37,019
If it’s just the two of us,
I don’t know what I’m gonna say.

264
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,650
You know…

265
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,818
There’s no point in me coming with you
if you’re gonna keep such a distance.

266
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:49,323
At least walk in front of me.
I’d worry if I can’t see you.

267
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,283
Right.

268
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,382
Actually, I’d rather not walk in front!

269
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,716
I feel uneasy about someone
walking behind me!

270
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,094
Oh, sorry… but…

271
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,639
Is it okay if I walk next to you?

272
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,808
I’d rather you do that, please.

273
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,318
-Thank you!
-F-- For what?

274
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:32,116
I thought you would never talk
to me again…

275
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,995
so I’m glad that you came tonight.

276
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,831
What are you talking about?

277
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,710
That’s nonsense.
Of course I'll talk to you.

278
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:43,711
I’m sorry.

279
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:47,381
Why are you apologizing?
You’ve done nothing wrong.

280
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,299
That’s not true.

281
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:53,929
The truth is, I’m a really horrible woman!

282
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,143
What do you mean horrible?

283
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,436
How horrible?

284
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,355
But it’s true.
You’re idealizing me for sure, Nobu!

285
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,233
Otherwise, there’s no way
you’d fall in love with me!

286
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,238
Aren’t you idealizing the creature
known as woman a bit too much?

287
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:16,493
If you knew the real me,
you'd be disappointed.

288
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,162
Don’t you think that maybe

289
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,372
she was lonely from her break-up
with her boyfriend?

290
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,589
Then disappoint me.

291
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,049
I want you to.

292
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:36,847
Because I don’t know what else
I can do to stop loving you.

293
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:53,781
Hey, Yasu, tell me the rest of the story
we were talking about earlier…

294
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,032
so that I can learn from you.

295
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,241
What about?

296
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,118
About Reira.

297
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,746
Didn’t you get jealous
after hearing Takumi’s beliefs?

298
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,250
Yeah, I got jealous. Real jealous.

299
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,168
Really?

300
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,587
I was jealous of his talent,

301
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,715
his confidence
and his reckless personality.

302
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,052
Reira was in love with Takumi.

303
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,807
Even before we started going out,
for some reason,

304
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,600
she liked to stick around me.

305
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,770
I’m a year older than her,
so I was like an older brother to her.

306
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:31,985
Takumi has always been a womanizer,
but he never approached Reira.

307
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,114
I guess you could say
she was really important to him

308
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,449
but only as his diva.

309
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,703
I love to sing

310
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,457
and would love
to become a singing machine,

311
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,002
a machine that has no desire
nor feels any jealousy,

312
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,713
a high-performance machine
that will never feel tired.

313
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,759
But if I throw away my emotions,

314
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,970
it would be impossible
to sing beautifully, wouldn’t it?

315
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,223
Being human is exhausting.

316
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,100
She captured my heart.

317
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:07,020
So then I convinced her to give up on him
and go out with me.

318
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,230
You convinced her.

319
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,774
But then when I started dating her,

320
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:14,486
I felt even stronger that
I could not compete against Takumi.

321
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,865
Looking back,
I know it was just petty jealousy.

322
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,534
I couldn’t bring myself
to be there for Reira

323
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,785
when she had issues with the band

324
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,913
and when she was worried
about moving to Tokyo.

325
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,917
I couldn’t support her
when she needed me the most.

326
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,419
So not surprisingly, we broke up.

327
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,632
But couldn’t you support her now, Yasu?

328
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:40,762
No. I doubt she needs my support anymore.

329
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,390
And besides, my hands are full
taking care of you guys right now.

330
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,104
I have to say goodbye to Takumi.

331
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,483
If I can’t do that, then
I must free myself from these arms.

332
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:58,155
I can say goodbye, can’t I? I can.

333
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,115
It’ll be okay.

334
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,868
And this time for sure,
I'll be really happy.

335
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:09,041
Because in these arms is
all the future I ever wanted.

336
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,792
That’s what I believe.

337
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,212
Where’s Hachiko?

338
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,880
Oh, she went to buy some stuff.

339
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:18,091
Gimme a break. Did I just miss her again?

340
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:21,261
-And after rushing to get here faster.
-She’ll be back soon.

341
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,930
She might be a while.

342
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,264
Why?

343
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,683
We sent her out with Nobu.

344
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,311
Really? Way to go, Shin!

345
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,480
Don’t come back until the morning!
I’m counting on you, Nobu!

346
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,690
Huh? But I thought
Ms. Hachiko has a boyfriend.

347
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,359
I bet 10,000 yen that they’ll do it.

348
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,027
I bet 10,000 yen that they won’t.

349
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,946
I bet 100 yen that he’ll come
before they even do it!

350
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,197
You’re so cheap.

351
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,918
Hey, Nana.

352
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:59,591
The feelings I swore that night
still remain unfaded in my heart.

353
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:06,265
Those shining dreams we had back then,
please don't forget them.
