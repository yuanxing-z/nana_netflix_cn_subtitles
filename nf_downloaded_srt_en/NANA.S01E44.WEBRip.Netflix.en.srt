1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:05,797
My dream was to make it big with my band

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,010
and have everyone in Japan know my name,

3
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:15,557
even if it meant that one person
would never call my name again.

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,696
BLACK STONES DRESSING ROOM

6
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,366
Our rehearsal is one hour long
and starts at twelve o’clock.

7
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,575
If you’re hungry,

8
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,494
you’d better eat a box lunch
while you have the chance.

9
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,746
You still have thirty minutes.

10
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,501
Hey, what’s this "run-through"
at 6:00 p.m.?

11
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,670
It’s a dress rehearsal.

12
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,421
You do the exact same thing
as you will live.

13
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:14,092
There’s a lot of time
between the rehearsal and the run-through.

14
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,426
Do we have other work during that time?

15
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,555
Today, there’s just this music show.

16
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,348
It’s your first time on live TV, isn’t it?

17
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,434
-Focus, and get yourself geared up for it.
-Well, then!

18
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,229
Can we go out before the run-through?

19
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,148
Did you listen to what I just said?

20
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,568
-Focus, I said, focus.
-I…

21
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,487
Is it okay if I take a nap in the car?

22
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,947
I’m about to pass out from lack of sleep.

23
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,032
And I can’t relax here.

24
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,876
Okay. That was good.

25
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,132
Yasu!

26
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,218
Yay! How’ve you been?

27
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,638
You’re always so loud, even on the job.

28
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,974
Traitor.

29
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:09,522
Women are so scary.
They can be so vindictive.

30
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:25,413
-Hey, Ren. I need to talk to you.
-About what?

31
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,457
Just come with me.

32
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,796
-Ren, are you still…
-No, I’m okay.

33
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,466
No, you’re not! Your eyes say so!

34
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,220
-It’s just a little…
-A little what?

35
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,263
It’ll never become a habit.

36
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,974
It already has, and you’ve gotta stop!

37
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,645
Sorry.

38
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,689
I’ll never do it again, so…

39
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,532
Ren…

40
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:06,913
Don’t worry.
I’m not gonna steal Nana from you.

41
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,878
I didn’t think so.

42
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:19,884
You’ve always let me have
whatever I wanted since long ago.

43
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,389
It pisses me off that
you’re looking down on me.

44
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:30,144
Whenever you’re not with Nana,
you become unstable like that!

45
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,481
-And it’s the same with Nana!
-Nana, too?

46
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,528
She’s been hyperventilating.

47
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,573
If this continues,
who knows how she’ll end up.

48
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,703
I realized it through that incident
with Takumi and Nana.

49
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:52,292
She’s probably quite traumatized
from being abandoned by her mom.

50
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,462
You’re not suited for this industry.

51
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,258
I really regret encouraging you
to come to Tokyo.

52
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,138
Don’t push yourself, Ren.

53
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,600
You’re not like Takumi or me.

54
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:13,438
Stop trying to reason it out,
and just do as you wish.

55
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,776
If you keep forcing things,
you’re not gonna last long.

56
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,694
SHIN - RE: DO YOU HAVE TIME?
I HAVE AN INTERVIEW FROM 3:00 P.M.

57
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:23,281
Shadow of Love is so great,
no matter how many times I listen to it.

58
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,700
Tonight’s show will be a good promo,

59
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,536
and I’m sure the initial stock
of the CDs will sell out right away.

60
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,829
You think so?

61
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,789
I think the sales department
is overestimating

62
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,125
by putting out 800,000 singles at once.

63
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,669
Don’t blame me if they’re stuck
with a bunch of leftover CDs.

64
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,796
By the way, how many is BLAST putting out?

65
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,839
I’m not sure.

66
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,425
Given all the publicity they’re getting,
they might break a million.

67
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:46,804
But I can’t imagine Gaia putting out
800,000 copies of a single

68
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,474
for a new band with no track record.

69
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,518
We’ll hit number one
on the charts for sure.

70
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,437
-You’re right!
-You think so?

71
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:58,066
If I were Gaia, I’d make that gamble.

72
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,692
One million copies on the first release.

73
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,652
I know it’s not my business,
but it’s kind of thrilling.

74
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,820
THRILLING?

75
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,156
But if it tanks,
that would be a tremendous loss!

76
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,033
They’ve already spent
hundreds of millions of yen

77
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:07,950
on promoting them.

78
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,037
That’s exactly why. They’ve come this far.

79
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,247
Now they have to recoup that investment.

80
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,957
If they release more singles than us

81
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,335
and become number one
with their first release,

82
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,962
then the party continues.

83
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,715
We’re living in a time
where popular things sell.

84
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:27,678
If there’s a pile of CDs from
a new band that’s just topped the charts,

85
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:31,474
you’re gonna buy it
purely out of curiosity.

86
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,437
Okay.

87
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,649
Thank you very much!

88
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:43,444
Hey, Ginpei, can I go out
until the run-through?

89
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,197
You’re being persistent.
Is it to see a woman?

90
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,573
I don’t have one.

91
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,866
Women are evil.

92
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,578
Ginpei, the car key…

93
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,790
Are you feeling all right, Shin?

94
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,667
I could find a vacant dressing room
for you to sleep in.

95
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,253
No. I’d feel more relaxed in the car.

96
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,839
Aren’t you being nicer to Shin
than to me, Ginpei?

97
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,217
Don’t come to wake me up until it’s time.

98
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,929
That kid has no stamina for his age.

99
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,932
I’d say you’ve got too much, Ginpei.

100
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,768
Nana, you should return
to your dressing room

101
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,437
and also take a nap
while you have a moment.

102
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,523
Yeah. I have my own private room,

103
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,651
so maybe I can relax
and get a little rest.

104
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:24,944
Wanna sleep with me?

105
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,446
Enough of that.

106
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,282
-Where’s Nana going?
-To her private room to take a nap.

107
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,659
How come girls get their own rooms?
Because they’re evil?

108
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,203
What do you mean, "enough of that"?

109
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,414
We haven’t done anything yet.

110
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:42,295
But how does Yasu manage
to stay completely harmless?

111
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:46,090
He’s like a Buddhist priest
who has transcended earthly desires.

112
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:50,678
Could that mean his love for me
is more like love between siblings?

113
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,639
TRAPNEST
MS. REIRA

114
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,853
But Yasu’s a guy. And all guys get horny.

115
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,397
I wonder if he jerks off to Yuri.

116
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,027
BLACK STONES
MS. NANA

117
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,654
I’ve neglected Ren for a month,

118
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,616
so he’s gotta be sleeping
with other women by now.

119
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,869
Not that I care. I’d actually be relieved.

120
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,498
Good work.

121
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,920
-What are you doing here?
-House-sitting.

122
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,422
Oh, I took a cigarette.

123
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,384
Leaving your stuff around
with the door unlocked is unsafe.

124
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,553
There are dangerous people
out there who will enter uninvited.

125
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,933
I agree! What if someone sees you here?
Get out!

126
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,060
Don’t be so upset.

127
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,646
I’m sorry that I neglected you
for a whole month.

128
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:46,275
No, I’m not mad.
After all, I’m just as guilty for that.

129
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,573
I have to… end it.

130
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,618
This style of dating…

131
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:59,497
to meet occasionally and talk
to each other, making love,

132
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,917
like we’re in some cool love drama…

133
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,878
It just won’t work for us.

134
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:11,717
If we can’t always be together,
it would be easier to just end it.

135
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,179
I’m sure Ren feels the same way.

136
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:16,931
Nana.

137
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,685
I have something to talk to you about.
Do you have time?

138
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,231
I prepared myself…

139
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,482
but I’m scared.

140
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,782
RE: DO YOU HAVE TIME?
I HAVE AN INTERVIEW FROM 3:00 P.M.

141
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:35,700
BUT I HAVE AT LEAST TWO HOURS.

142
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,034
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU’RE DONE
REHEARSING, AND I’LL HEAD OVER.

143
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,927
That was fast.

144
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,097
I was hiding behind the car.
I just couldn’t wait.

145
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,308
This Volkswagen bus is so cute!

146
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,892
It stands out, so I found it right away.

147
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,896
You’re so lucky to get to ride
in this every day.

148
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,150
Actually, I think it’s a problem
to have our car stand out.

149
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,987
But the glass is tinted,
so no one can see in, right?

150
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,991
So we can do anything.

151
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,618
What do you have in mind?

152
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,995
What do you wanna do, Reira?

153
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,955
"Look each other in the eye
and talk without pretense."

154
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,170
Let me do what you wanna do, Shin.

155
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,755
Huh? What I wanna do?

156
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,924
I’m no longer your client.

157
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:42,099
But doing what an adolescent boy
wants to do

158
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,935
is not much different
from what we’ve been doing.

159
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,230
There’s no point then.

160
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,608
I’ll quietly listen to anything
you wanna talk about.

161
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,194
But there’s a difference
between doing it for someone

162
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,362
and having it done for you.

163
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,707
Why don’t you sit down?

164
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,590
No, not there. Over here.

165
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:15,925
What’s wrong with this one?

166
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,136
We’re not gonna be making out
while having this conversation, are we?

167
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,976
Well… that‘s up to you.

168
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:35,778
What is it?

169
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,117
Ren’s lost some weight.

170
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,994
I wonder if he’s been eating properly.

171
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,407
-Nana…
-What is it? Just say it!

172
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,785
-I feel like I could suffocate and die!
-Marry me.

173
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:45,139
-What’s going on? A drama?
-A drama? Who’s in it?

174
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,108
What are you doing here?
Don’t you have rehearsal?

175
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,278
Is that supposed to be a disguise?

176
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,030
It actually makes you stand out more.

177
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,531
I got a little time off,

178
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,367
so I wanted to come and see
how you look as an actress.

179
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,827
I’m just an extra.

180
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,079
That bank employee uniform
looks good on you.

181
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,957
-You look so grown-up.
-I kind of feel that…

182
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,668
you’ve been trying to make
a move on me since this morning.

183
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,961
No! I didn’t mean to…

184
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,047
Well, maybe a little…

185
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,049
Don’t tease grown-ups.

186
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,054
No, wait!

187
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,140
I may look like a kid,
but I am twenty years old!

188
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,101
Really? I thought you were
probably still in high school.

189
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,854
I’ll be 21 in three months.

190
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,565
-January? What day?
-The 23rd.

191
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,025
Then you’re an Aquarius.

192
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:42,404
Yep! All the guys in my band are Aquarius.

193
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:46,492
You’re a Virgo, right?
Born on September 12, blood type A.

194
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,826
My blood type’s A, too.

195
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,454
You look like you’re in your teens,
but you’re 22, right?

196
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,707
I was surprised
when I saw your profile at the agency.

197
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,751
But if we were in school,
we’d only be one grade apart.

198
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,086
That’s what my profile says.

199
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,588
Huh? How old are you really?

200
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:01,966
Twenty-seven.

201
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,177
Don’t be so obviously shocked.

202
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:06,929
I’m sorry.

203
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,098
It’s fine. I’m used to it.

204
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,642
-Now get back to work.
-Yes…

205
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,602
It’s over.

206
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:17,648
There’s no way someone seven years older
would pay any attention to me.

207
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,734
Age aside, she probably thinks
she can’t depend on me.

208
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,404
So you want to be supported
by these frail arms?

209
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,364
Yes, totally.

210
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,283
It’s impossible.

211
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:34,039
When I was a child,
I thought no one would ever love me.

212
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:39,461
So that winter back when I was sixteen
and got involved with Ren,

213
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:43,299
I thought I was having
the most unbelievably happy dream.

214
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,134
It didn’t feel real.

215
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,803
Shin…

216
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,556
It’s my birthday next week.

217
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,099
Happy birthday!

218
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,810
There’s nothing happy about it!
I’ll be 23!

219
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,313
-I’ll be an old lady!
-That’s still young.

220
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,524
But I’ll be eight years older than you.

221
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,861
Still seven years.
My birthday’s next week, too.

222
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,070
I’ll be sixteen.

223
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,363
Huh? What day?

224
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,991
November 1st. Scorpio, blood type AB.

225
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,411
-We’re the same!
-Really?

226
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,830
It’s the red string of fate!

227
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,416
But you don’t believe in fate, right?

228
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,376
I believe it now.

229
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,883
To be loved by the man I love…
To me, that was a miracle.

230
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,428
I thought we were destined to be together.

231
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,431
Nana…

232
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,185
Will you?

233
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,565
Again? You’re such a pervert.

234
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,319
No, that’s not what I’m talking about.
Will you marry me?

235
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,490
-Impossible.
-If you won’t, I’ll die.

236
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,824
Then go ahead and die!

237
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,327
When I die, I’m bringing you with me.

238
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,671
Then kill me.

239
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:17,643
He nearly did kill me.
And then he took me to Heaven with him.

240
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,645
I guess I’m a pervert too.

241
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,273
You’re looking much better, Nana.

242
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,859
-Were you able to get some sleep?
-Shut up, baldy! Just shut up!

243
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,529
-What are you upset about?
-Because you didn’t wanna do it with me,

244
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,699
-I ended up doing it with Ren again.
-Well, Nana’s rage is usually irrational.

245
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,993
And that idiot totally got carried away.

246
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:34,910
I SERIOUSLY ALMOST DIED

247
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,079
I definitely will not marry him.

248
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,123
She probably looks better
because of the makeup.

249
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,833
That’s Mika’s great technique!

250
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,836
I think it’s the pheromones.
That’s Ren’s technique.

251
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,964
I saw Ren leave Nana’s dressing room.

252
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,383
That was a bold move to do it
right in your dressing room.

253
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,968
-It wasn’t…
-That’s good news.

254
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,594
What’s so good about that, baldy?

255
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,762
There’s no need to hide it.

256
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,808
All of us staff know the two of you
are truly lovey-dovey.

257
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,768
We’re not lovey-dovey at all!

258
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,062
-He snuck in without my permission!
-Nana.

259
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,939
Ren may try to act cool,

260
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,191
but he’s no different
from how he was as a kid.

261
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,820
Be a little kinder to him, will you?
Please.

262
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,655
I see…

263
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:17,911
Yasu is harmless
not because he’s achieved enlightenment

264
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,622
or because he sees me
as his little sister…

265
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,540
Yasu!

266
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,627
It’s simply because…

267
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,629
I’m Ren’s woman.

268
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:33,385
Why didn’t I ever notice something
so obvious before?

269
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,721
-This is like a class reunion!
-Lots of coincidences, right?

270
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,264
The reason Yasu sacrifices himself

271
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,849
-to protect me
-You did this on purpose,

272
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,309
-is so he can support Ren,
-using us as bait!

273
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,895
-who can’t take action himself.
-You just wanted to see me, right?

274
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:47,983
Yasu’s bond with Ren is much stronger
than the one he has with me

275
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,737
because they’ve been together
since Ren was born…

276
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,281
in the same orphanage.

277
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:01,622
My last ray of hope has been severed.

278
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:07,336
No one can save me from the pain…

279
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,838
of drowning in Ren’s love.

280
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,511
It’s a destiny I can’t escape.

281
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,727
-Yo, Nobu. You doing okay?
-Y-- Yes.

282
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,021
How does this guy manage
to throw people into Hell

283
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,481
just by being there?

284
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:31,610
His existence itself is evil.
This guy’s definitely the Demon Lord.

285
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,278
-Long time no see, Nobu.
-Your woman is totally weird.

286
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,863
And you too, Shin. How’ve you been?

287
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,865
It’s been a while, Reira.

288
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,410
There she is. Reira in person.
She has finally made her appearance.

289
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,913
We finally perform on the same stage.

290
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,206
STARE

291
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,666
And she’s looking at me.

292
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,377
She’s coming!

293
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,212
She’s coming.

294
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:51,839
She’s coming.

295
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,549
She’s coming!

296
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:58,428
Glad to meet you, Nana!
I’m Reira of Trapnest!

297
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,638
I hope we get along!

298
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,764
Okey-dokey!

299
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,307
LOST THE WILL TO FIGHT

300
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,101
I can’t underestimate this woman.

301
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,395
What a huge TV!

302
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,606
I coaxed him for the biggest one,
and he got it for me.

303
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,275
I also rearranged the room.

304
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,653
Don’t you think you’re going
a little overboard with everything?

305
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,196
You do realize how spoiled you are,
don’t you?

306
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,908
That’s not true!
He’s being really strict with me.

307
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,909
He tells me if I don’t behave,

308
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,537
he won’t blow-dry my hair
after I take a bath.

309
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,247
Dry it yourself!

310
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,749
I wish eight o’clock would arrive sooner.

311
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,334
There’s still another two hours!

312
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,004
Time passes whether you want it to or not.

313
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,464
In the meantime, aren’t you hungry?
Let’s order delivery.

314
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,968
If you don’t mind salad and spaghetti,
I can make that right away.

315
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,846
I made lots of tomato sauce
with the tomatoes from your place.

316
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,433
Wow. You’ve become
quite an expert in cooking.

317
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,393
You used to be the expert
in falling in love at first sight.

318
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,854
Mm-hmm. It turns out I really enjoy it.

319
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,314
My nausea’s subsided,

320
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,816
so I may just attend cooking class
and become a real expert.

321
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,985
Seeing that you’ve found
something you’re good at,

322
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,404
I guess it was worthwhile coming
to Tokyo after all.

323
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,032
But if I had lived alone,

324
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,659
I probably would’ve never learned
to cook much.

325
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,078
I wouldn’t have the urge to cook
anything special for myself.

326
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,538
Yeah, I know what you mean.

327
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,792
I guess I like cooking for people
and having them enjoy it.

328
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,921
I can feel that
even I am of use in some way.

329
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,464
On top of that,

330
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,758
Nana would always use
way too much seasoning in her cooking,

331
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,384
so I ended up cooking almost every day.

332
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,011
So naturally, I got better at it.

333
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:24,306
I mean, that much sodium
can’t be good for your health.

334
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,892
Then, I guess it’s all thanks
to the guru, huh?

335
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:27,976
Huh?

336
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,647
Nana’s also the one who brought
you and Takumi together, right?

337
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,319
You’ve been telling me all kinds
of stuff, but you know,

338
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,113
I’ve never seen you so happy, Nana.

339
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:44,076
I think you finally have
both feet on the ground. I’m relieved.

340
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:49,331
-Hey, Hachi. Back then…
-Here are your positions for the opening.

341
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,874
Everyone, please come forward.

342
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,294
I was deeply regretful
for introducing you to Takumi.

343
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:00,842
But if you’re still with him now
and you’re happy,

344
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,345
that makes me feel a little better.

345
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,350
That’s my only ray of hope.
