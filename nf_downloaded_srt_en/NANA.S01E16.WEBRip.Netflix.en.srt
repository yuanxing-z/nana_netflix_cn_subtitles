1
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:08,216
That night, Nana took Misato by the hand

2
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:10,760
and left the flat without saying a word.

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:14,055
She didn’t return until morning.

4
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:30,822
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

5
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,182
-Yes.
-It’s me.

6
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,894
What is it, so early in the morning?

7
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,647
Same goes for you.
What’s up with that outfit?

8
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,731
Are you going to work already?

9
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:33,069
No, I came back from work
and continued working.

10
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,197
Work? But it was a public holiday.

11
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,284
Law firms can be really busy, huh?

12
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,493
When do you get any sleep?

13
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,037
I was gonna take a nap
before going back to work.

14
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,747
I’m coming in.

15
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,381
What are you doing here?

16
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,846
I was hanging out with Misato
in her hotel room,

17
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:03,683
but a single bed just
isn’t big enough for two people.

18
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,477
That girl’s still here? What about school?

19
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,896
She says her school is full of floozies

20
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,648
and she has no real friends,
so she doesn’t wanna go.

21
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,484
But her parents must be worried.

22
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,028
That girl looks like the princess type
from a wealthy family after all.

23
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:20,491
Actually, I hear they don’t really care.
It’s like what Shin was saying.

24
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,910
Maybe she’ll end up
running away from home.

25
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,165
Shin… He’s becoming quite a handful.

26
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,542
I just hope he doesn’t get in trouble.

27
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,502
He’s taken on
a different appearance lately.

28
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,254
Talk about appearance, Yasu.

29
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,923
I’ve been thinking for some time now…

30
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,550
you look scarier without your sunglasses.

31
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,678
Shut up.

32
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,389
Usually, it’s the other way around.

33
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,809
Either way, it’s not the look of a lawyer.

34
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:51,064
Nana… If you’re gonna sleep,
go sleep at your own place.

35
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,023
Wanna sleep with me?

36
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,817
What are you saying? Don’t mess with me.

37
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,277
Then I’m leaving.

38
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,534
Wait.

39
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,204
You wanted to talk to me
about something, didn’t you?

40
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,163
What happened?

41
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,625
Sorry for coming without a reason.
Good night.

42
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,070
Nana!

43
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,541
I return to work today,
so I’d better get some sleep.

44
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,336
Or so I thought,
but I couldn’t get any sleep.

45
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,424
Nana!

46
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,345
I’m sorry.

47
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,181
I didn’t mean to say the things I said.

48
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,266
Just, some things happened,

49
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,185
and I was irritated,
and I guess I took it out on you.

50
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,645
I’m really sorry.

51
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:14,981
Are you mad at me?

52
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,650
I’m not mad, really.

53
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,945
Just like you said, I got carried away
and did as I wanted.

54
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,865
Then why didn’t you come home
until morning?

55
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,951
Nana, you don’t carry a cell phone,
so I didn’t know what to do.

56
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,870
I kept thinking about it
and couldn’t get any sleep!

57
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,538
Am I your boyfriend or something?

58
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,457
You’re more important to me
than a boyfriend.

59
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,000
By the way, what happened to Misato?

60
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,085
Did she go home?

61
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,463
No. She’s at the hotel sleeping.

62
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,132
She said that she might go home
after she checks out at noon today.

63
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,217
-Is that so? What should I do?
-About what?

64
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:48,389
She must think I’m such a bitch.
She didn’t do anything wrong.

65
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,309
She was having so much fun,
and I ruined it all.

66
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,727
I want to apologize.

67
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,313
Say, does she have a cell phone?

68
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,355
Yeah, she does.

69
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,316
Give me her number. I’ll give her a call.

70
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,819
Sure, but she’s likely still asleep,
so wait until after noon.

71
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,905
-Mm-hmm!
-Hold on a moment.

72
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,576
I have it written down somewhere.

73
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,787
Hey, Nana. What time
can you make it home today?

74
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,330
Give me some space!

75
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,790
Can we have dinner together?

76
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,541
That’s fine with me,
but it’ll be like nine o'clock tonight.

77
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,960
Then I’ll cook something
to make it up to you.

78
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,921
-Here.
-Thanks.

79
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,466
I’m off!

80
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,931
RECIPE OF THE DAY
RICE HAMBURGER STEAK

81
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,183
What should I cook for dinner?

82
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,185
I ended up not making
hamburger steak last night,

83
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,478
so maybe I'll make that.

84
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,442
I wonder what that girl made for Shoji.

85
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,777
What are you looking at, Ms. Komatsu?

86
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,029
The office computer is not
for personal use.

87
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,866
Y-- You’re mistaken, Ms. Sakagami.
I was thinking about a new project.

88
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,785
What do you think
about having a segment on cooking?

89
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,663
The readers of our magazine
aren’t all women!

90
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,290
But in this day and age, men need
to know more about cooking too.

91
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:59,210
Don’t talk back to me. Besides,
you don’t have the experience

92
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,336
to be talking about new projects.

93
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,131
All you need to do is complete
the tasks you’ve been given.

94
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:07,009
What’s with her?
She’s treating me like some servant.

95
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,678
Though in a way, I am one…

96
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,389
Where are you going, Ms. Komatsu?

97
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,765
I’m going for lunch!

98
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,354
I wanna hurry and quit this job.

99
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,816
But I need to find my next job
before I do that,

100
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:27,363
or else Nana will tell me to move out.
But we just made up.

101
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,867
That’s right! I have to call Misato.

102
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,209
Hello.

103
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,045
Oh, hello, Misato? It’s Nana Komatsu.

104
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:48,634
Ms. Komatsu? I’m really sorry.
I was being such a nuisance.

105
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,137
No, I’m the one who needs to apologize.

106
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,306
-Huh?
-I called to apologize about yesterday.

107
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,185
I’m really sorry.
I was not my usual self yesterday.

108
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,896
Um, come visit us again anytime, okay?

109
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,398
Nana and the other band members
would be glad to see you.

110
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,317
I’ll keep you informed
about their upcoming live concerts.

111
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,111
Sure! Thank you very much.

112
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,696
Where are you now, Misato?

113
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,115
Oh, I’m on the train, on my way home.

114
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,784
I see. Sorry for not seeing you off.

115
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,579
No, that’s okay. I’m grateful as it is.

116
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,873
Being able to have dinner
with the Blast band members

117
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,583
and the chance to talk with Nana…

118
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:25,087
I’m so happy I could die.
It’s like I’m still in some dream.

119
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,255
You’re exaggerating.

120
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:31,511
No, really. I’ve been a Blast fan
since the very beginning,

121
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,346
but nothing like this has ever happened.

122
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,555
It really is like a dream to me.

123
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,851
I see. When you say
since the very beginning, when was that?

124
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,937
It was with the first set of members,
back when Ren was in the band.

125
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,064
So almost four years ago?

126
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,607
First members, when Ren was in the band?

127
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,109
No way, it can’t be this Ren.

128
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:52,031
It was a shock when Ren left Blast,
but don’t you think Shin,

129
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,825
the new bassist, plays just like Ren does?

130
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,746
So at the live concert, it was like
a revival of the Blast of old times.

131
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,457
I was really thrilled.

132
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,793
Name a guitarist you respect.

133
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,127
Ren Honjo!

134
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,379
Oh, which reminds me,

135
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,507
I’ll be going to Trapnest's concert
in my hometown soon.

136
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:14,011
I’m so happy that I’ll have the chance
to see Ren perform in person again.

137
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:18,224
That’s the flower of the lotus, isn’t it?
Why did you choose the lotus?

138
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,976
Actually, it’s the ren.

139
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:22,979
Ren…

140
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,732
No way.

141
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,239
I need to calm down.

142
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,116
I need to calm down and think.

143
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,036
Trapnest’s Ren is Blast’s former bassist?

144
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,331
Judging from what Misato said,
there’s no mistake about that.

145
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:47,128
But why? Not one of them
said a word about it,

146
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:50,506
not even when Shin and I
were talking about Ren.

147
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,383
Then were they keeping it a secret?

148
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:56,846
Furthermore, if that tattoo
on Nana’s arm signifies Ren…

149
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,682
Are Nana and Ren lovers?

150
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,476
They make a great couple! That’s so cool!

151
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,146
I get it! Ren is a popular celebrity.

152
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,815
And that’s why they’re keeping
their relationship a secret.

153
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,735
From that perspective, everything
makes more sense now, I think.

154
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,237
Yasu’s stoic behavior.

155
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,906
The fact that Nana
avoids talking about herself.

156
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,535
Nana often goes out at night saying
she’s going to work,

157
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,787
but she’s in fact out to secretly see Ren.

158
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,164
She goes out wearing Vivienne Westwood

159
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,540
when she says she’s going
to work after all.

160
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,375
Maybe that’s what’s happening.
I’ll bet it is.

161
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,711
What am I gonna do? I wanna know more!

162
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,213
So much that I couldn’t possibly
keep my mind on work.

163
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,507
I have to find out the truth.

164
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,718
But Nana said she won’t be back
until around nine,

165
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,511
and she doesn’t carry a cell phone.

166
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,096
What am I gonna do?

167
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,558
Still that’s no reason
to come to my place.

168
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,853
Please tell me, Nobu.
You know a lot about this, don’t you?

169
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:49,065
I assure you, I won’t sell
the story to the press.

170
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,860
No, I’d never imagine you as a woman
who would do such a thing, Hachi.

171
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,070
Don’t call me Hachi!

172
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:59,283
Shin! That’ll stunt your growth!
And why are you so calm?

173
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,326
You’ve always respected Ren, right?

174
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,161
Because I already knew.

175
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,874
Why? Did you by chance become
a member of Blast

176
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,209
knowing you’d be taking Ren’s place?

177
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,627
What do you mean?
You had this all planned out?

178
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,838
No. Nobu got drunk and told me.

179
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,173
I did?

180
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,800
I figured you might not remember.

181
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,676
No way! When?

182
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,428
Right after I became a member of Blast.

183
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,848
Shin, if you knew, why didn’t you
tell me anything about it?

184
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,226
Because everyone avoids talking about Ren,

185
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,353
to the point that it’s obvious,

186
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,980
so I figured I’d be better off
pretending I never heard anything.

187
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,816
I’m the worst.

188
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,901
You are such a grown-up, Shin.

189
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,779
If it was me, I would never be able
to pretend I didn’t know anything.

190
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,864
I tend to get all worked up about it,
like I’m doing now.

191
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,117
That’s what’s so cute about you, Hachi.

192
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,035
Cute?

193
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,079
Don’t mess around!

194
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,872
I wasn’t really messing around.

195
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,041
It’s been a while
since someone said I’m cute.

196
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:53,337
Hey, Shin, what exactly have I told you?

197
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,172
I’ll tell you everything I know.

198
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,217
Because I might’ve told you lies,
since I was drunk, you know?

199
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,887
Ren was Blast’s bassist.

200
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,639
He and Nana were lovers,

201
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,808
and they lived together,
but two years ago,

202
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,602
he was offered the chance
to become Trapnest’s guitarist.

203
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,439
He came to Tokyo alone,
and no one’s heard from him since.

204
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,274
So I told you everything.

205
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,986
Wait! No one’s heard from him since?
Then what about him and Nana?

206
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,822
They had a tearful breakup, right?

207
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,992
That’s right. And there’s nothing left
for me to tell you.

208
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,745
Tearful?
But just because Ren came to Tokyo,

209
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,997
that doesn’t mean they had to break up.

210
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,709
You’re right. You had
a long-distance relationship

211
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,086
with your boyfriend, Hachi,
and it has lasted.

212
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,005
Well, yeah…

213
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,341
Actually, that came to an end
after I came here.

214
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,635
-You broke up with your boyfriend?
-It came to an end?

215
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,636
You’re kidding!

216
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,847
But we just went to his workplace
the other day.

217
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:51,604
Yeah, but… somehow, after that…
Never mind about me.

218
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:56,317
I’ll bitch to you about the whole thing
over some drinks another time.

219
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,360
No. I’m done with alcohol.

220
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,530
Is it something to bitch about?
Did he cheat on you?

221
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,032
Bingo.

222
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,577
A-- Anyway, right now, we’re talking
about why Nana and Ren broke up.

223
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,289
I suggest you talk to Nana directly
about their reasons for breaking up.

224
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,249
No, that wouldn’t be good!

225
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,250
Why’s that?

226
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,545
Listen, everyone’s got
a couple of painful memories

227
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,047
they’d rather not share with anyone.

228
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,174
Is it that painful of a memory?

229
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,885
But if they broke up in tears,

230
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,929
that would mean they were
doing great until then, right?

231
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,766
That’s right, but how can I say it…

232
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:33,187
I don’t hate Ren,
and I don’t wanna badmouth him,

233
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,439
but Ren decided to leave Blast
and join Trapnest

234
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,151
without talking it over
with Nana or myself.

235
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,153
Only Yasu knew about it.

236
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:46,909
So at that time, I really felt betrayed,
and it came as a great shock.

237
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,704
As a fellow musician, my pride took a hit,

238
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:51,747
and I felt frustrated.

239
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:56,001
But both Nana and I
acknowledged Ren’s talents,

240
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,795
and we respected that.

241
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,965
We could predict that this would be
better for Ren’s sake,

242
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,508
and of course, that proved to be true.

243
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:07,846
I believe this was the best outcome.
But Nana…

244
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,645
Back then, she could’ve gone
with him if she desired.

245
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,481
But rather than choose happiness
as a woman,

246
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,109
she chose to protect her pride.

247
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,238
I think that’s the reason why she’s
so insistent on succeeding as a musician,

248
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,948
no matter what.

249
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,783
She has her heart set on someday reaching

250
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,286
the level of success
Ren… Trapnest is enjoying.

251
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,123
Shin, surpass Ren.

252
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,168
Sometimes, it pains me
to see her like that.

253
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,463
To be honest,

254
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,925
I'm not sure whether or not
Nana still has feelings for Ren,

255
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,804
but both Yasu and I feel awkward
talking about Ren in front of her.

256
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:53,267
We weren’t necessarily keeping it
a secret from you guys.

257
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,895
So both of you, there’s no need

258
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,689
for you to act like
you don’t know anything,

259
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:03,777
but I don’t want you asking her
about this just to satisfy your curiosity.

260
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,280
I understand.

261
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:12,494
But I must’ve mentioned
Ren many times in front on Nana.

262
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,123
Ms. Komatsu! It’s already three o’clock!

263
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,958
-Then I was hurting Nana’s pride
-How far did you go for lunch?

264
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,335
-every time I mentioned Trapnest.
-My goodness!

265
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,878
-Although I knew nothing about this,
-Your stance toward your work

266
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,338
-I feel bad about it.
-is not right! You’re practically

267
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,422
-I’m gonna stop asking her
-stealing your salary

268
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,548
-to come to the live concert with me.
-from the company! Excuse me!

269
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,425
-Naturally, she won’t wanna go
-Are you listening, Ms. Komatsu?

270
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,469
to a Trapnest live concert.

271
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,223
It’s okay
as long as you’re feeling remorse.

272
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,767
I went a bit too far.

273
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,019
Just be careful
this doesn’t happen again, okay?

274
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,606
That’s right.
In order not to hurt her again,

275
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:45,861
I’ll cautiously but casually bring up
the subject of Ren.

276
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,658
-Did Yasu come?
-Huh?

277
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,618
This is Yasu’s, right?

278
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,662
There’s no other guy
who would smoke those odd cigarettes

279
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:55,746
with that distinctive smell.

280
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,499
So they do have a distinctive smell?

281
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,876
I always thought it had
a nice, sweet scent.

282
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,419
Really?

283
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,172
But these aren’t Yasu’s. They’re Shin’s.

284
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,548
I confiscated them from him.

285
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,718
Huh? What is it with Shin?

286
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,054
There’s no sense in me holding onto them,

287
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,138
so go ahead and smoke them, Nana.

288
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,141
No, I don’t care for these.

289
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,978
Leave them here,
and Yasu will smoke them when he’s here.

290
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,230
Wait a minute. When did you see Shin?

291
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,441
I bumped into him
when I was coming home from work.

292
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,485
Oh?

293
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:30,948
What am I doing lying to her?
I should just tell her the truth.

294
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:34,660
There’s something fishy here.
Don’t go after Shin.

295
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,496
To him, a working woman is
a woman to get money from,

296
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,455
even if that woman is you.

297
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,332
It’s nothing like that.

298
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,167
Then that’s fine.

299
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,462
By the way, did you call Misato?

300
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,008
It was with the first set of members,
back when Ren was in the band.

301
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:49,925
Yeah.

302
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,219
I wonder if she got back all right.

303
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,930
Mm-hmm. She said she was
on the train on her way home.

304
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,682
I’m glad to hear that.

305
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,064
You know, Nana, about Ren of Trapnest…

306
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,650
This is about the live concert, right?
Sure. I’ll go.

307
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,695
Huh? Why?

308
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,197
I told you I’d go if I felt like it.

309
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,824
So what made you feel like going?

310
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,201
No reason. Just felt like it.

311
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,244
But…

312
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:20,164
What? If you have plans
with someone else, that’s fine with me.

313
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,207
N-- No, let’s go together.

314
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,334
I’d be super happy to go with you, Nana.

315
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:30,090
Why? Does she want to see Ren after all?

316
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,094
Maybe she still has feelings for Ren.

317
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:38,348
I want to ask her,
but I mustn’t be hasty about it.

318
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,893
Even if I ask, Nana’s not likely
to be direct with me.

319
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,895
She won’t give me an honest answer.

320
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,521
She’ll get embarrassed and say

321
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,399
she’s changed her mind
about going to the live concert with me.

322
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,569
I wonder if I should ask her
after the live concert.

323
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,405
This is a golden opportunity for them
to get back together.

324
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,158
If I don’t watch it, I could ruin things.

325
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,786
We have first row seats.

326
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:03,373
The concert hall is small.
Ren will surely notice Nana there.

327
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,795
The girl he had a tearful break up with
will suddenly be standing before him.

328
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,838
Ren won’t be able to resist
getting closer to her!

329
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,841
They will silently look
in each other’s eyes.

330
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,927
Nana’s eyes will be filled with tears.

331
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:15,844
Without a second thought,

332
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,806
Ren will jump down from the stage
and embrace Nana.

333
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,599
Beautiful!

334
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,311
I should keep quiet,
so Nana doesn’t change her mind.

335
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:27,856
At least until the concert. I’ll do it.
I’ll act as if don’t know anything.

336
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,149
I am an adult after all.

337
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,610
For the sake of an exciting reunion.

338
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,863
Sure. I’ll go along with your story.

339
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,032
I acted like I didn’t know
until now anyway.

340
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,534
Thank you, Shin!

341
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,452
But I envy you.

342
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,871
First row seats, right?
I’d like to come too.

343
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,998
Yeah, I’m sure you would. I’m sorry.

344
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:49,169
But I wonder if the reunion will be
as exciting as you’re thinking, Hachi.

345
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,548
Well, I agree maybe imagining him
jumping off the stage is a stretch.

346
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:57,177
Still, I wonder
if Ren still thinks about Nana.

347
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,138
They haven’t been in touch
for two years, right?

348
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:03,475
Yeah. I wonder about that.
To start with, that guy…

349
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,144
"To start with that guy," what?

350
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,146
Rumor has it he’s a real womanizer.

351
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,063
Really?

352
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,733
Well, but that’s something from his past.

353
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,695
As far as Nana was concerned,
he was very faithful to her.

354
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,823
Oh, and that necklace
Ren’s always wearing?

355
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,033
Nana gave that to him.

356
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,326
No way, really?

357
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,203
That’s a totally good sign
he still has feelings for her!

358
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,705
But maybe he just likes it,

359
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,790
and there’s no real reason
behind him wearing it.

360
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,292
That can’t be.

361
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,920
It definitely means something to him.
Hey, Yasu, don’t you agree?

362
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,091
Yeah, I do.

363
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,926
I knew it!

364
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:41,847
What’s the matter?

365
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,933
Come on, everyone, practice time.
Let’s give it our best today too.

366
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,436
That dampens the mood.

367
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,981
That was two weeks
before the live concert.

368
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,774
As my heart pounded

369
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,860
worrying about the possibility
of Nana changing her mind,

370
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,905
my imagination just kept escalating.

371
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,991
If Nana and Ren got back together,

372
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,242
would that mean members of Trapnest

373
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,244
could come visit us at our place?

374
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,748
Then maybe I could become
all lovey-dovey with Takumi.

375
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,167
What am I gonna do?

376
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,753
What’s the matter, Ms. Komatsu?

377
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,485
Yes.

378
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,779
It’s me.

379
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,532
You again?

380
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,494
What do you want this late at night?

381
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,081
The morning of the live concert, Nana,

382
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:54,002
you were sitting by that window,
the same as always.

383
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,257
But there was a different scent
in the room,

384
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,760
the scent of Black Stone,

385
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,512
those cigarettes I confiscated from Shin

386
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,847
that you said you don’t care for.
