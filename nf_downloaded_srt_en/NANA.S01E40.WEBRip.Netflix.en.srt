1
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:05,463
The top story
was not of some severe situation

2
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:08,925
that would cause people to frown
or at all serious in nature.

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,722
But it was a sudden live coverage
on a peaceful morning

4
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:17,017
of a scandal involving one singer
with too much makeup.

5
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:22,480
It made a great impression,
and I figured we had a chance.

6
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,420
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

7
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,118
Hey, did you watch
this morning’s Morning 7?

8
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,245
-Yeah. About Nana, right?
-Who’s that?

9
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,496
Ren’s girlfriend.

10
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,249
-What? What kind of girl?
-She pisses me off.

11
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,292
But she was really pretty, wasn’t she?

12
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,253
You think? Her gaze was too strong.

13
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,088
-Maybe she put a curse on you.
-A curse?

14
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,923
Girls nowadays are quite cunning.

15
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,258
I mean, using a man to become famous?

16
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,301
I can’t forgive her. She deceived Ren.

17
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,512
Oh, you’re a fan of Ren Honjo?

18
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,556
Me too, ever since
that canned coffee commercial.

19
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,100
That bass player was so cool.

20
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,768
Never mind Nana. What’s his name?

21
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,520
The bassist? I wanna know
the name of the guitarist.

22
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,230
What is it? What’s the band’s name?

23
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,774
Try making your own flowers bloom.

24
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,026
Boss, I don’t understand
what you’re saying.

25
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,864
-Hello, this is Gaia Records.
-We’re terribly sorry.

26
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,157
-The release date for their debut single
-We will make an official announcement

27
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,783
-hasn’t been determined yet.
-once the details have been worked out.

28
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,497
We have no choice but to do it,
Mr. Kawano.

29
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,834
In response to all the calls,

30
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,421
every department is set
on going ahead with this now.

31
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,506
This is no joke.

32
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,176
If we promote them because of this now,
it would be nothing but a set up.

33
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,054
When this magazine goes on sale tomorrow,

34
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,181
Nana will be under more fire.

35
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,894
Talented musicians getting their careers
destroyed by relentless slander

36
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,522
and record companies
who care only about profit.

37
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,983
You’ve seen it before,
haven’t you, Matsuo?

38
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,528
But all your efforts to this point
would be wasted

39
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,946
if they replaced you with another manager.

40
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,034
I say don’t go against it
and just do as the agency says.

41
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:26,581
That proper way of thinking
will only be shunned by our superiors.

42
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:30,001
The fact that you weren’t informed
of this incident ahead of time

43
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,544
is proof of that.

44
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:35,340
Anyone in this industry
can easily figure out

45
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,551
that our agency was involved
with that broadcast.

46
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,097
And the media jumped
on this scoop knowing that fact.

47
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:50,063
The party has already started.
There’s no turning back now.

48
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,235
He’s taking me lightly, that raccoon man!

49
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,362
What a cheap hotel!

50
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,949
He should have gotten us a suite
or a deluxe room!

51
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,076
I totally agree. This is too rude.

52
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,996
You think so? I think we’re fortunate
they decided to protect us.

53
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,459
But they could’ve at least put us
in a hotel with room service.

54
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,460
I’m hungry.

55
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,212
Want me to go and buy something?

56
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,714
-Sushi!
-Got it!

57
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,301
I’m going then!

58
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,096
Misato?

59
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,349
Welcome back, Yasu.
How were things at Gaia?

60
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,268
What are you doing here?

61
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,478
She saw the TV show this morning
and got worried,

62
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,188
so she rushed over here.

63
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,439
What a girl.

64
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,859
But I’m relieved to see that
you’re looking well, Nana.

65
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,362
How did you know we were in this hotel?

66
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,906
Shin emailed me to let me know.

67
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,908
How thoughtful of you.

68
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,743
I knew she would come.

69
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,871
Misato says
she’ll be staying here for a while.

70
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,999
She can run errands for us,

71
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,126
since we’re not allowed to go anywhere.

72
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,336
I’m in room 712.

73
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,088
Feel free to call me for anything.

74
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,464
But what about school?

75
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,675
No need to worry about that.

76
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:02,927
Then here you are.

77
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:03,886
SEASONAL CUISINE

78
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,764
It’s from Mr. Nishimoto at Gaia.

79
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,599
Misato, would you mind eating my share?

80
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,851
All right! Food!

81
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,228
I couldn’t do that!

82
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,146
No, really.

83
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:17,442
Actually I just had lunch
with Mr. Kawano, so I’m not hungry.

84
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,235
There’s no need to hold back.

85
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,321
Thank you very much.
I’m sorry for always being a burden.

86
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,238
Make me some tea.

87
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,198
Say, who is this Nishimoto?

88
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,576
He’s the general manager
of the production department.

89
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,328
He came to see us at the studio once.

90
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,829
Oh, right.

91
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:33,124
But so many people came to see us,
so I don’t remember him.

92
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,500
What kind of person is he?

93
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,919
He looks like a fox.

94
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,713
A fox?

95
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,178
Gaia has too many shady guys!

96
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,929
Nana, it’s super fancy sushi!

97
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,477
Nishimoto’s a great guy.

98
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:57,190
But for someone in his position
to treat us to an expensive meal…

99
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,775
Is it almost decided? Your debut?

100
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,694
Yeah. I guess they feel
they could make a few bucks

101
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,279
on the present exposure we’re getting.

102
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,531
That fox sure is predictable.

103
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,492
Congratulations.

104
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,412
But there’s no need
to push yourself, Nana.

105
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:15,708
If you don’t feel like doing this,
just don’t sign the contract.

106
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,836
Oh, that’s right.
Sorry for getting carried away.

107
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,923
What are you saying? We’ve gotta do this.

108
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,384
I threw my stupid pride away already.

109
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,302
Now that it’s come to this,

110
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,930
I’m gonna take advantage of you
any way I can, Ren Honjo.

111
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,848
I’ll make it big in this world,

112
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,142
no matter what dirty tricks
I must use to get there.

113
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,978
I’ll become so big,
no one will be able to talk back to me!

114
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,063
Nana, you’re awesome!

115
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,357
-Awesome! Awesome!
-Did you just realize that?

116
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,776
-Awesome!
-I can’t use chopsticks…

117
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,863
Where’s Nobu?

118
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,283
He’s apparently locked himself
in his room.

119
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,661
Those rich boys are so weak.

120
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,079
I SAW YOU ON TV! COOL!
ARE YOU GONNA BECOME FAMOUS?

121
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:53,996
GIVE ME YOUR AUTOGRAPH.

122
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,000
NANA IS SO PRETTY. INTRODUCE HER TO ME.

123
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,127
I’D LOVE TO BE DECEIVED
BY A GIRL LIKE THAT!

124
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,131
WHAT’S HACHIKO? NANA’S PET DOG?

125
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,684
You can’t lure me with food anymore!

126
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,687
No. That's not my intention, so eat up.

127
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:27,155
I’m not at all happy that our debut
was decided in this way.

128
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,699
I’m surprised Nana’s going along with it.

129
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,993
Where has her pride gone?

130
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:37,081
Overcoming adversity is her pride.

131
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,252
But I have my pride too.

132
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,005
In the end, Gaia could care less
about our music.

133
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,884
Is this what a big record label
should be doing?

134
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,471
You know, that’s how
all big companies operate.

135
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,681
-If it sells, anything goes.
-Yasu!

136
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:58,269
And Gaia likely has something to do
with all this commotion as well.

137
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,396
I knew it.

138
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,650
This is no more than a speculation
by Mr. Kawano and Mr. Matsuo.

139
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:11,365
The TV station that airs
Morning 7 has two music shows,

140
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,495
and there are also other shows
that Gaia is tied to.

141
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,372
So you see, they have to get along
with each other

142
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,500
to maintain their present relationship.

143
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,837
For the network to introduce
our band like that,

144
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:29,926
they must’ve contacted Gaia ahead of time.

145
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,054
Otherwise, they would never mention
the company name.

146
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,809
The show probably acted
like a promotion for us

147
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,813
because Gaia allowed the show
to air under such conditions.

148
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,733
Should the tactic fail
and we end up getting crushed,

149
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,902
Gaia would lose nothing from it.

150
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,239
They’re the worst.

151
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,951
Nana’s sucking it up,
but she’s gotta be really hurt by this.

152
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,704
I don’t wanna debut
through an agency like that.

153
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:06,254
But no matter who you team up with,
there will always be a hidden side.

154
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,465
The good thing about Gaia is,
if they want to,

155
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,467
they have deep pockets to assist us with.

156
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,971
It’s one thing to be all about music,

157
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,473
but unless people get to hear it,
what’s the point?

158
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,226
If we’re going pro,

159
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,019
then it’s to our advantage
to team up with a place

160
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,481
that will dish out the most money
for production and advertising.

161
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,820
I’m sure there are a number of things
you’re not satisfied about, but…

162
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:35,449
Lately, my life’s been full
of things I’m not satisfied with.

163
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,161
Then you must’ve figured it out by now.

164
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:44,333
Justice doesn’t always prevail
in this world.

165
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,046
If you don’t wanna lose,
you’ve gotta be tough.

166
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,384
You’ve gotta be more cunning.

167
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,855
If you can’t do that,
go back to Terashima Inn.

168
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,823
When I turned on the TV,
the afternoon talk show was on.

169
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,492
Ren was surrounded by reporters.

170
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,706
Watching him in the lobby
of the international airport walking fast

171
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,961
and without saying a word,
I felt a bit left behind again.

172
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,425
I have no idea where Ren was going.

173
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,596
I don’t even know what he is aiming for.

174
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:46,812
I remembered us talking about
living together in that warehouse again

175
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,940
and began to think that it was
even less likely to come true

176
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,986
than my dream of making it as a singer.

177
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:05,456
Hey, Jun-chan, I wonder where Ren flew to…

178
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,457
leaving Nana behind.

179
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,959
What I wanna know is how long
do you plan on staying here?

180
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,880
If Ren went overseas,
does that mean that Takumi went too?

181
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,173
Without me?

182
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,885
Kyosuke tells you to come here
and then runs off to school.

183
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,595
Men can be so selfish.

184
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:22,139
When’s he coming back?
We haven’t made up yet after that fight.

185
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,307
What should I do?

186
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,811
Nana, you should go back to your parents.

187
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,562
That would be the best for everyone.

188
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,688
No way!

189
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,858
Not after Nana sent me
that beautiful message of encouragement!

190
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,778
Was that a message of encouragement?

191
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,864
Nana’s hanging in there,
no matter how tough things are for her,

192
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,741
so I’ve gotta pull myself together
and do my best too.

193
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,952
No, in your case, the more you try,

194
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,662
the more you cause problems
to those around you.

195
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,789
You’d do better quietly starting
from square one.

196
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,541
Can I reach him on his cell
while he’s overseas?

197
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,376
Maybe I can still catch him.

198
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,670
She’s not listening one bit.

199
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,923
I’m looking forward to London.
I wonder how Stella is doing.

200
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,926
Who’s Stella?

201
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,428
Takumi’s lover in London.

202
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,637
-Lover in London?
-Lover in London?

203
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,014
Wow. He’s even got one overseas.

204
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:04,974
And she’s blonde.

205
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,392
-She’s blonde?
-A blonde?

206
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,186
He not only has one in England.
He also has…

207
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,689
Oh, Takumi! Thank goodness I got through!

208
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,065
-The US, China…
-What? Really? Awesome!

209
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,525
-Oh, hello. Sorry we’re late.
-What’s the matter?

210
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:20,322
Um, I-- I’m sorry. I said
some horrible things this morning.

211
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:21,824
This morning?

212
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,206
What do you mean troublesome?

213
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,459
Outsiders like you need to shut up!

214
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,210
Oh.

215
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,712
That's all.

216
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,380
Sorry. During a crazy time,

217
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,716
I know an "outsider"
like me shouldn’t be calling you.

218
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,598
SO SAD…

219
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,558
Hello?

220
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:53,189
Listen, I’m going to England tomorrow.

221
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:58,819
I’ll email you the hotel’s number,
so call me there if you need to reach me.

222
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,988
They have Japanese speaking staff
at the front desk.

223
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,240
From tomorrow? For how long?

224
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,035
Hmm… Probably about half a month.

225
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,077
Half a month?

226
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,830
It’s only half a month.

227
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:11,999
Even if I was here,

228
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:16,003
I wouldn’t be able to see you
in this commotion, so it’s the same.

229
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,714
It’s not the same! It’s totally different!

230
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,674
Really?

231
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,844
Anyway, that’s how it is.

232
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,680
I won’t be able to go see
your parents for a while.

233
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,600
Please explain the situation to them
and apologize for me.

234
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:34,355
Then maybe I’ll go back to my parents
while you’re in England.

235
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,648
It would be lonely staying here.

236
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,233
Yeah, why don’t you do that?

237
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,319
So what have you decided to do?

238
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,820
Will you raise the child
at your parents’ place?

239
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:45,241
No way! I want my own family.

240
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,825
I’ve decided that no matter what happens,

241
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,037
you and I and the baby
will live happily together.

242
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,667
Just the three of us? We can have more.

243
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,212
Come on. We don’t need to have more
for no reason.

244
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:02,591
Just help me raise a good kid.

245
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,801
I got it.

246
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:08,931
I’ll buy you a gift from England.
Is there anything you want?

247
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,391
A diamond ring!

248
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,354
Right. Come to think of it,
I didn’t get you an engagement ring yet.

249
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,606
-What size?
-Seven.

250
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,149
Roger.

251
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,155
Jun-chan! He’s getting me
an engagement ring as a present!

252
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,198
Congratulations.

253
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,119
Our dreams are finally coming true.

254
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:36,208
But the ideals we want
and the reality that presses against us

255
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:40,421
always stand staring at each other,
and things don’t quite work out.

256
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,385
Let’s drink.

257
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,637
Nana…

258
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,266
You said something about Hachi on TV,
didn’t you?

259
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,727
I just sent her a secret message.

260
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,104
I’m getting all kinds of emails

261
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,898
from people wanting to know
what Hachiko is.

262
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,609
It’s worse than the spam mail
I get from dating sites.

263
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,944
-Oh, sorry.
-It’s okay.

264
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,948
To be safe, I told everyone that
it’s your pet dog.

265
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,953
I really am sorry.
I keep causing you trouble.

266
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,664
If you had never gotten involved with me,

267
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,959
you would likely have had
a more peaceful life.

268
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,547
It’s okay.
I’m doing this because I want to.

269
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,342
I guess I’m living in a story

270
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,595
where I’m at the mercy
of women named "Nana."

271
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,096
What story is that?

272
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,098
The story of Nobu!

273
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:37,478
Then the name of the next woman
appearing in that story will also be Nana.

274
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,939
Please spare me from that.

275
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:47,154
I’m sorry, but I can’t erase Hachi

276
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,365
from my story.

277
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,454
She’s not likely to disappear
from my story either.

278
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:04,088
But I’m probably long gone
from Hachi’s story.

279
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,719
Hey, Jun-chan, look.
Such a beautiful moon.

280
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,472
Putting that aside,
are you planning on staying over?

281
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,725
But it’s not round.
I wonder when the next full moon will be.

282
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,020
If you’re planning on staying,
I’ll tell Kyosuke to stay at--

283
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:24,441
You know, Jun-chan,
that night of the full moon

284
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,695
was probably
the happiest moment of my life.

285
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,571
Which night?

286
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,659
I felt that I had everything I wanted.

287
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,662
My heart was filled with hopes and dreams,

288
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,331
and my future appeared
to be shining brightly.

289
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:46,672
I don’t think I’ll ever be enveloped
by such pure happiness again.

290
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:54,054
I thought I could do anything for Hachi.

291
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,348
But in the end, when I was challenged,

292
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:00,477
I couldn’t do anything. I am pathetic.

293
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:06,608
She is really the worst kind of woman,
so why can’t I give her up?

294
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,866
There’s no need to give her up.
There’s still hope.

295
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,034
Where?

296
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:19,538
You just need to go along with my plan.

297
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,206
What plan is that?

298
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,084
The plan to get Hachiko back.

299
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,462
Once she’s back in our yard,
you can breed with her again.

300
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,506
You’re still talking about her
as if she’s a dog.

301
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,217
Stop grumbling! If you’re a man, fight!

302
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,927
I don’t need you telling me.
Sure, I’ll fight!

303
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:44,146
My plan is simple.
Keep showing Hachi sweet dreams.

304
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,942
We, BLAST, just have to keep appearing
in Hachi’s story

305
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,653
as the really cool band.

306
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,657
Then, eventually,
she will return for sure.

307
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,784
NANA OSAKI

308
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:01,497
That cold-hearted man who’s always
shoving the cruel reality onto her

309
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,958
cannot bring happiness to a woman
like Hachi who loves to be spoiled.

310
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,587
CONTRACT

311
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,882
We plan to use all
our company's resources to promote you.

312
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,218
We have high hopes for you.

313
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,677
Let’s do our best together.

314
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,518
Nana!

315
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,904
We plan to hit number one
with our first release.

316
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,489
We look forward to working with you.

317
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,744
Ren!

318
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,883
Have a look.

319
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,594
-Big boobs!
-No, not the big boobs.

320
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,264
THE DARK PAST OF THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
WHO STOLE THE ROCK-N-ROLL HERO’S HEART

321
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,474
Beautiful woman?

322
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:07,646
The title has no class,
but the content is just as bad.

323
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,482
They probably instigated the situation.

324
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,318
They must really like your woman.

325
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,612
Well, even I fell for her.

326
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,827
And Gaia eagerly supports this.

327
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,580
I have a bad feeling.

328
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,666
What?

329
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,627
Are you returning this?

330
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,797
Nana?

331
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,133
Long time no see, Mr. Nakamura.

332
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:40,053
You weren’t here when I came to rent it,
so I thought you had quit.

333
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,346
I’m glad to see you looking well.

334
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,474
Did you come back because you missed me?

335
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,018
Can you overlook my late fee?

336
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:46,977
Sure.

337
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,270
Lucky me!

338
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,480
I’m feeling great today.

339
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,232
Maybe I’ll drop by the beauty salon
near the station.

340
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,193
I wonder if it’s still there.

341
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:59,114
Hello, Ms. Hachiko?
BLAST’s debut date has been decided!

342
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,533
Really? When?
