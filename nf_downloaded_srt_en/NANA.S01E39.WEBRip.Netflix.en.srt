1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:07,090
At the time, I didn’t have a TV
or a phone in my room.

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,136
As a result, I was the last one
to join the party.

3
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,972
It couldn’t have been more annoying.

5
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,706
Kyosuke! Turn on the TV! The TV!

6
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,417
What’s the matter
this early in the morning?

7
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,003
Just turn it on!
You’ll know when you see it!

8
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,171
Did something happen?

9
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,089
REN HONJO’S LOVE LIFE REVEALED!

10
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,383
The guru is on TV!

11
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,262
Hey, that’s that cute girl!

12
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,638
Hey, you’re right.

13
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,641
That cute girl is just as cute
on TV, isn’t she?

14
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:26,396
-I think she’s more beautiful than cute.
-No way!

15
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,648
Why is my sister’s friend going out
with Ren?

16
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,691
What’s the meaning of this?

17
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,735
-I don’t get it!
-You’re too loud. I can’t hear the TV.

18
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,864
Could that mean the man who got
Sis pregnant is also a celebrity?

19
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,949
She said he works
in the music business, right?

20
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,034
-Who is he? Who is he?
-How should I know?

21
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,871
Why didn’t you ask her?
What kind of parent are you?

22
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,999
The guy got my daughter pregnant!
He must be a jerk!

23
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,793
-Damn him! Leave me alone!
-So that’s it?

24
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:52,088
You only pretended to be lenient
to hide your jealousy.

25
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,423
Nami.

26
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,759
Let’s just hope he works
for a proper company.

27
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,553
He’s coming over on Sunday.

28
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,430
-Don’t say anything rude to him, okay?
-Huh?

29
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,391
He’s coming over? I can’t wait!

30
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:08,104
Black Stones is a band that Ren
started back in his hometown.

31
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:12,150
The vocalist Nana,
who was 16 years old at the time,

32
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:16,029
apparently frequented Ren’s place,
where Ren was living alone.

33
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,448
Ren was invited to join Trapnest
just before their major debut,

34
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,408
so he left his band to join them, right?

35
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,661
And the two broke up once at that time.

36
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,579
Yes.

37
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,749
Leaving a band could get ugly,

38
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,793
and I hear Nana has a temper problem.

39
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,464
She apparently bad-mouthed Ren
to people around her.

40
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,590
That’s a lie!

41
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,551
Be quiet! Whether it’s true
or not doesn’t matter!

42
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,098
We’re going to a commercial break.

43
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,893
Morning News 7

44
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,145
What do you mean it doesn’t matter?

45
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,605
Oh, Take.

46
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:56,361
Yeah, I’m watching it.
Why at a busy time like this?

47
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,363
Give me a break.

48
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,950
I kept telling him to be careful.

49
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,743
This is gonna be so troublesome.

50
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,120
What do you mean troublesome?
That’s a terrible thing to say!

51
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,957
I said be quiet!
Outsiders like you need to shut up!

52
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,126
No, sorry.

53
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,586
Outsiders?

54
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,090
So where’s Ren?
He’s not with that woman, is he?

55
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:22,679
Is that so? Then keep an eye on him,
so he doesn’t get out.

56
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,348
Just make sure that he doesn’t go
and see that woman.

57
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:27,642
Yeah.

58
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,648
No, I’ll go to the office right away.

59
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,359
Nana!

60
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,111
Where do you think you’re going?

61
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,862
I’m going back home to see
how Nana’s doing!

62
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,281
I’m worried about her!

63
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,616
Please don’t do anything unnecessary.

64
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,326
But this isn’t unnecessary!

65
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,537
Takumi, there’s something not right
about you as a person!

66
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,382
If you think that,
then don’t force yourself to marry me.

67
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,429
If there’s something not right
about the father,

68
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,890
the child isn’t going to amount to much.
I’m a good example of that.

69
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,519
Just having parents
doesn’t make it all right.

70
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,688
If it’s hard by yourself,

71
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,357
then go back and raise it
at your parents’ place.

72
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,484
And don’t worry. I’ll support the child.

73
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,904
In any case,
the way things are shaping up,

74
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,157
I won’t be able to come here
for some time.

75
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,992
Do as you wish.

76
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,497
Hello, Nana?

77
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,417
Could the Takumi you were talking
about be Takumi of Trapnest?

78
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,922
No. You have it wrong.

79
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,924
You’re lying. Tell me the truth.

80
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,469
When I think about it, everything adds up.

81
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:48,514
Why are you hiding it from me?
That’s so cold of you.

82
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,933
Did you think I would tell anyone?

83
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,021
What’s the matter? Why are you crying?

84
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,690
Jun-chan. I…

85
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,444
I’m not forcing myself
to get married only for my baby’s sake.

86
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,946
I know that.

87
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,825
I really love Takumi.

88
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,829
I know. I’m glad you realized that.

89
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,666
But I thought it was Nobu
I was in love with.

90
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,293
That’s just your imagination.

91
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:21,297
As long as a man treats you nicely,
it doesn’t matter to you who it is.

92
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,757
That’s not true.

93
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,927
I know that you feel bad for Nobu,

94
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,845
but it’s better to come
to terms with your feelings

95
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,264
rather than convince yourself that
it's for money or for the child.

96
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,937
But it was easier to think that
it was for those things.

97
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,857
Why is it that when I go after a guy,

98
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:44,487
I always end up with self-centered jerks
like Mr. Asano and Takumi?

99
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,448
Huh? I don’t know.

100
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,910
So she loved Asano that much?
Enough to still talk about him?

101
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,205
Why can’t I treat guys like Shoji and Nobu

102
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,916
with as much care as they show me?

103
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,379
If Shoji didn’t get sick of me,
I’m sure we would’ve lived peacefully,

104
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,506
and that would’ve been best for me.

105
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,717
Why is she talking about Shoji
at this stage?

106
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,011
And that it would’ve been for the best?

107
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,765
At this rate, I’ll never be happy
for the rest of my life!

108
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,226
-I'll pass it to you!
-Huh?

109
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,477
Calm her down.

110
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,771
Come on. Just say something
that’ll make her feel good.

111
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,233
Hello, Nana?

112
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:28,531
Do you have to delay your wedding
because Trapnest is caught in this mess?

113
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,243
WAAAAAAAA!!

114
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,621
Takumi, you idiot! You bastard!

115
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:39,876
Anyway, come by our place.
We’ll listen to your problems.

116
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,918
What about class?

117
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,047
No, I’ll be fine.

118
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,633
But above everything, I wanna see Nana.

119
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,386
I wanna apologize to her properly
and make up with her.

120
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,263
I’m thinking about going now
to see how she’s doing.

121
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,807
Huh? Go to the apartment?

122
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:01,105
-Right now would not be a good time.
-Why?

123
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,275
-There are reporters at your apartment.
-What?

124
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,569
We are in front of the residence
of Nana from BLAST.

125
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,668
Oh no!

126
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,795
I’m gonna be late!

127
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:29,800
Who is it so early in the morning?
Yes? Who is it?

128
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,260
We’re from Search.

129
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,263
Huh? If you’re selling something,
I don’t want it!

130
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,432
You’re Nana Osaki, right?

131
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,979
We would like to ask some questions

132
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,564
regarding your relationship
with Ren Honjo.

133
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,899
It’s one thing to show Ren’s place,

134
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,151
but why the guru’s home, too?

135
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,070
She’s not a celebrity yet!

136
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,989
It’s a unique building,
and with the surrounding view,

137
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,324
you can easily tell where it is.

138
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,992
They should sue them for this!

139
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,203
What’s Yasu doing? Isn’t he a lawyer?

140
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,038
He's gotta do something about it!

141
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,707
Anyway, Nana, given what we’re seeing,

142
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,169
it’s quite possible that they’ve already
found out that Nana had a roommate.

143
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,381
You could end up being showered
with questions.

144
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,423
It’s better if you don’t go.

145
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,425
But Nana’s…

146
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,971
I understand how you feel,
but think this through.

147
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,182
It would be nothing but trouble
if they find out who you are.

148
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:22,144
What if they find out
about your relationship with Takumi?

149
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,397
If they make a big deal about it,

150
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,440
Takumi will end up
in an unfavorable position,

151
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,151
and you and your child will have
a tough time living a normal life.

152
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,614
Please don’t do anything unnecessary.

153
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,867
Nana will be all right.

154
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,579
She’s a smart girl,
and she has her band members.

155
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,584
I’m a lot more worried about you.
Don’t go now.

156
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,847
Nana Osaki!

157
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,392
Search… does he mean Search,
the weekly magazine?

158
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,729
Please come out for a moment
and talk to us.

159
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,896
We saw you on TV.

160
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,398
On TV?

161
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,317
If you don’t hurry up
and give us an explanation,

162
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,402
things could get pretty ugly for you.

163
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,154
An explanation?

164
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,281
Is that okay with you?

165
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,700
I don’t understand
what he’s talking about.

166
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,285
Is he threatening me?

167
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,206
And finally, let’s take another look
at BLAST’s live video.

168
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,668
Their debut single is expected
to be released soon by Gaia Records.

169
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,170
I can hardly wait.

170
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,553
Nobu… This program is kind of strange.

171
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,391
It’s like they’re taking advantage
of Ren’s scandal to promote us.

172
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,359
Nobu! Shin!

173
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,364
-You’re here.
-Mr. Kawano.

174
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,199
Neither of you would answer your phone,

175
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,241
so I was getting worried.

176
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:04,246
I’m sorry. I had turned mine off
because friends were calling me non-stop.

177
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,123
Then did you see the broadcast?

178
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,249
Yes, we saw it.

179
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,753
Then I can get right to the point.
There’s a car waiting outside.

180
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,004
Pack your bags quickly.

181
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,255
Pack our bags?

182
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,467
Just in case, you are to hide
in a hotel until things calm down.

183
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,261
There’s a good chance
reporters will come here.

184
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,846
Wait a minute!

185
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,390
What in the world’s going on?

186
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,850
How come we’re debuting all of a sudden?

187
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,478
We’ll talk about it in the car.
We should hurry.

188
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,604
What about Nana?

189
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,481
I left Nana to Yasu.

190
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,692
I’m sure he’ll be able to deal
with the media in a professional manner.

191
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,111
Don’t worry about it.

192
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,987
I am worried!

193
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,907
With all this mess going on,
Nana won’t be able to sing!

194
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,368
Is Gaia behind that show?

195
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:45,037
That’s the video we sent in when
we were promoting ourselves, isn’t it?

196
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:49,041
But that video had been sent
to many places, right?

197
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,920
I hate to say this,
but I can’t trust you, Mr. Kawano.

198
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,506
You keep saying things to satisfy us,
but they’ve all been lies.

199
00:11:56,257 --> 00:12:00,261
I don’t think I’m gonna be able
to trust anyone anymore.

200
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,308
In fact, both Yasu and I received
blocked calls this morning

201
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,728
telling us to "Watch Morning 7."

202
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,647
What’s that? A telephone threat?

203
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,650
Whoever’s behind this,
I’m not clear what their motive is,

204
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,403
but what’s clear is
that they’re doing this

205
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,655
so the public will pay attention to you.

206
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:22,950
But who would do such a thing
other than Gaia?

207
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:26,454
The only one who would benefit now
by promoting our band is Gaia!

208
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,623
You really are a good person
right down to the core, Nobu.

209
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,834
You don’t think that perhaps the objective
is not to promote the band

210
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,085
but to crush it?

211
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:38,132
Everyone who watched that
on TV will think it’s weird.

212
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,731
You’re a member of Black Stones,
aren’t you?

213
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,899
Did you watch Morning 7?

214
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,067
Is it true that Nana’s the one
who put that padlock on Ren?

215
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,905
What did you think when Ren left
your band to join Trapnest?

216
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,199
What’s going on?

217
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,576
He’s a friend of Ren’s girlfriend!

218
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,205
Didn’t Nana sell this information herself?

219
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,124
It’s a publicity stunt!
Taking advantage of Trapnest’s popularity!

220
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,378
SILENCE

221
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:21,842
Listen, you guys.

222
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,095
If you have the time to mess
with other people’s gardens,

223
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,223
try making your own flowers bloom.

224
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,398
REN HONJO’S LOVE LIFE REVEALED?

225
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,402
Back to you from the home
of Nana, Ren’s love interest.

226
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:46,575
Oh, boy. He’s made enemies out
of the media. That idiot.

227
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,577
He’s so cool!

228
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,495
TAKUMI!

229
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,957
Yasu is really awesome!
I’m sorry that I called him baldy!

230
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,377
I wanna be Yasu!
But I don’t wanna be bald!

231
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,756
But look at Ren’s popularity.

232
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,716
All the talk shows are talking
about the same subject.

233
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,095
Isn’t that nice? It just shows
how peaceful this world is.

234
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,137
PEEVED…

235
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,973
It’s supposed to be
about Ren’s passionate love,

236
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,975
but they’re talking about BLAST
more than our band.

237
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:14,728
Oh? You hate to lose, huh?

238
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,482
No, I don’t care if I win or lose,
as long as we get attention.

239
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,444
Let’s hold a press conference, Takumi.

240
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,822
We’ll have Ren tell them
something really cool.

241
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,782
Like "Don’t pick on my woman"
or something like that.

242
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,992
Get real.

243
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:31,120
I’m not gonna be part of this silly party.

244
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,623
Don’t come crying to me
if BLAST walks off with everything.

245
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,709
That’s fine by me.

246
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,086
We’ll maintain our own pace
and rely on our talent.

247
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,838
As long as our CDs sell,
everything’s fine.

248
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,299
You sure are confident.

249
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,093
Do you really think that
you’re the best in the world?

250
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,845
Of course not.

251
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,057
But I do think that
you’re the best in the world.

252
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,145
Don’t add any more pressure!

253
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,605
-I hate you!
-Mari. Coffee.

254
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,689
Yes.

255
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,065
Nana!

256
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,568
This is the worst.

257
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,904
Rumors are circulating that
this is a publicity stunt.

258
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,572
Doesn’t that make you angry?

259
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:11,076
The last thing I wanted was
to be known as "Ren’s woman."

260
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,622
If you’ll talk, I’ll write an article
to explain your views!

261
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,415
You’re being a pest, damn it.

262
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,625
Nana!

263
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,629
Don’t try to be friendly with me.
It’s all over now.

264
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:25,132
-It has all fallen apart because of you!
-Nana!

265
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,509
It's the guy from Black Stones.

266
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,553
Don’t dare come inside! Go away!

267
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,432
Come on. I’m only giving her
a chance to redeem…

268
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,482
Don’t act like you’re doing us a favor.

269
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,944
Never come close to our vocalist again.

270
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,992
I’m gonna write
about what happened just now!

271
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,954
If you wanna save the reputation of
the legal firm that’s been so good to you,

272
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,205
submit your resignation letter!

273
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,214
Nana.

274
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,479
Are you all right? Ow!

275
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,898
You idiot!
What are you acting so cool for?

276
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,858
Think about the position
you’re in first, baldy!

277
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,904
It’s okay. I don’t hold
an important position at the firm,

278
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,823
so quitting won’t affect anyone.

279
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,449
But it will affect you!

280
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,536
If word gets out that you used violence,
no one’s gonna hire you!

281
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,871
Don’t throw your life away!

282
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,169
It’s okay. Now I can go out
and gamble to my heart’s content.

283
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,673
This guy’s a fool.

284
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,260
All our members are fools.

285
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:56,140
Nobu got disowned by his parents
and dumped by his girlfriend,

286
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,434
yet he still clings on to his guitar.

287
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:03,689
Unless something’s done about Shin,
he’s on a direct path to destruction.

288
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,236
And if I don’t sing, we have no future.

289
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,239
We are in front of the home
of Trapnest’s Ren.

290
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:16,076
The person at the center
of this vortex has not yet appeared.

291
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,911
Moments ago, his agency announced that

292
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,914
they will be taking
a "no comment" stance on this subject.

293
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,207
This adds to the speculation

294
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,335
about this being a publicity stunt
by Black Stones’ Nana--

295
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,300
Mr. Honjo!

296
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,053
We got directions from the agency.

297
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,721
"You’re to fly to England this afternoon."

298
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,139
I’m running away?

299
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,308
Am I a criminal?

300
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,061
It’s for a shoot for the cover
and a promotional video.

301
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,189
We had planned to do it in Japan,
but with this commotion…

302
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,400
You’ll spend about two weeks there,
so you should be able to relax a bit.

303
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,446
The other band members and staff
will be going tomorrow,

304
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:56,617
but you and Mr. Takeda
will be going first.

305
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,369
-I’ll drive you to the airport.
-I got it.

306
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,622
I’ll get ready right away.

307
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,083
Things should be a lot quieter
if it’s only me and Take.

308
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,125
Um, Mr. Honjo.

309
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,421
Are you sure you don’t have
to help your girlfriend out?

310
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,840
If you wanna retaliate on the media,
I won’t stop you.

311
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,472
Sadly, my woman has too much pride.

312
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,683
The more I try to protect her
in front of the public eye,

313
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,352
the more miserable she’ll be.

314
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,854
What do you mean? I doubt that!

315
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,607
Why do you always do exactly
as the agency tells you to?

316
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,068
No, she really is like that.

317
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:34,947
This aggressive change in schedule
must be Takumi’s idea!

318
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,700
Mr. Honjo, you ought to do as you wish!

319
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,996
Kinoshita, you’re missing the point here.

320
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,332
Music is not fun and games for us.

321
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,294
Trapnest is no longer Takumi’s own castle.

322
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,255
It’s a major project that
involves the agency,

323
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,341
the record label, and other companies.

324
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,761
I can’t just do as I please.

325
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,809
Being in a band is like sharing
a single destiny.

326
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,604
Right now, the people I must protect

327
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,232
are not the friends I abandoned long ago.

328
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,528
Nana, please make a statement.

329
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,738
When Ren was invited to join Trapnest,

330
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,991
was it you that broke off
the relationship?

331
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,076
Did you get back together with him
to take advantage of him?

332
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,037
Ren says he has no comment about this.
How do you feel about that?

333
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,291
Are you happy that you’re getting
all the attention according to your plan?

334
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,084
This is stupid.

335
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,252
Say something.

336
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,130
I don’t need to say anything.

337
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:38,802
Ren understands me,
and I know the position Ren is in.

338
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,262
There’s no need to make a fuss.

339
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:47,769
But right now, there’s one thing
I must say no matter what.

340
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,521
Please say something!

341
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,857
I won’t let them ruin my life.

342
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,920
Just watch me, Hachiko.
I will make your wishes come true!

343
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:19,927
I hope you’ll be on TV a lot.
Let me see you as you continue singing.

344
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,264
-Oh, I feel much better now.
-I’m glad.

345
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,397
That’s all from the home of Nana,
the woman of the hour.

346
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,112
She just threw them a smoke bomb.

347
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,572
The title of the next show
will be something like

348
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,659
"A fearless Nana sends
a mysterious message to her pet dog."

349
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,536
That will take them
even further off track.

350
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,996
Yeah, she’s fearless all right.

351
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,624
And I’m sure they thought
she was talking about a dog.

352
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,921
You know, Hachi…

353
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,675
Ever since that day,
I was able to get right back up,

354
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,219
no matter how many times
I got struck down…

355
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,721
THE DARK PAST OF THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

356
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,058
…because I knew
you were always watching me.

357
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,518
WHO STOLE THE ROCK-N-ROLL HERO’S HEART
