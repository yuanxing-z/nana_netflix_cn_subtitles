00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,564
A month after I moved to Tokyo,

2
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:25,275
my incredible luck…

3
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,531
came to an end.

4
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:47,797
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

5
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,713
I'm broke!

6
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,173
Naturally.

7
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:19,139
But why? I worked so hard
and saved up before coming here,

8
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,391
yet I only have 2,228 yen left.

9
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,935
If you spend your money, it runs out.

10
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:29,858
You went on this crazy spending splurge
of clothes and furniture.

11
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,861
But Mr. Mizukoshi gave me a good deal
on everything I got from there.

12
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,737
On top of that, rather than cash,

13
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,865
he offered to deduct the amount
for the clothes I got from my salary.

14
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,076
That’s why you didn’t have
much of a salary last month.

15
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,703
That’s right! Isn’t it horrible?

16
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,955
-Do you think I was tricked?
-You did it to yourself!

17
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,583
What about you? Do you have
enough money to get by, Nana?

18
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,253
You don’t have a full-time job,
just temporary stuff from time to time.

19
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,172
Unlike you, I don’t waste my money.

20
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,550
-Thank goodness.
-Don’t rely on someone else’s money!

21
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,135
I have no intention of doing so.

22
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,595
Then what did you mean?

23
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,180
You see, if we both didn’t have money,
it would lead to anxiety, don’t you think?

24
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,516
You are relying on my money!
Don’t count on it!

25
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,896
We agreed to split the rent
for this place by exactly half.

26
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,856
If you can’t make arrangements
for funds by the end of the month,

27
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,983
I’m kicking you out.

28
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,611
-You devil!
-Huh?

29
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,946
It wouldn’t bother you if I laid
in the streets dying, would it, Nana?

30
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,032
Dying once may do you good!

31
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,408
Please, don’t abandon me!

32
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,868
Let go of me! I’ll be late for work.

33
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:22,994
Work?

34
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,079
What kind of work are you doing
at this hour of the night?

35
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,497
Is it an S&amp;M club?

36
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,999
What do you care?

37
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,793
Have a good night with the ghosts.

38
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,464
No way…

39
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,053
No. This is no time
to be afraid of ghosts.

40
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,721
My problem is money.

41
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:45,183
There’s over half a month
until my next payday.

42
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,602
Can I survive on 2,000 yen?

43
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,979
What am I to do? This is getting scary.

44
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,565
Having no money is scary!

45
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:57,362
I didn’t come to Tokyo to experience this!

46
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,240
Then why did you come?

47
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,329
To make it on my own?

48
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,414
Then solve this on your own.

49
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,457
But how?

50
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,833
That’s for you to figure out!

51
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,211
But I don’t know how to be a dominatrix!

52
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,379
A dominatrix?

53
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,507
Talk to Shoji and have him feed you
until the end of the month.

54
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,758
I can’t do that.

55
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,177
If I talk to Shoji about this,
he’ll hate me

56
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,471
and for sure no longer wanna be with me.

57
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,641
Also he’s very busy with work
and his studies at university,

58
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,102
so I’d only be a nuisance
bothering him at this late hour.

59
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,187
You got that right!

60
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,648
I get it, Nana. So don’t cry.

61
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,317
Use this to hold you over
until the end of the month.

62
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,740
Kyosuke! We cannot afford that!

63
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,326
I’m not giving it to her.
It’s just a loan.

64
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,998
No way. Give Nana cash, and you’re certain
it’ll be all gone in a day.

65
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,166
That’s a cruel thing to say, Jun-chan.

66
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,086
-What?
-Rice.

67
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,171
My parents sent me some.
I’ll share it with you.

68
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,550
You can feast on this
until the end of the month.

69
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:07,307
No way! No way! No way!

70
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,808
Hey, what about meat and vegetable dishes?

71
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,731
It’s all right. Calm down and think.

72
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,609
My next payday is on the 26th.

73
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:24,490
If I don’t buy anything from the store,
I’ll receive at least 70,000 yen.

74
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,451
But I’ll be debited for my cell phone,

75
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,078
so I should deposit 10,000
into my bank account.

76
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,955
That leaves me with 60,000.

77
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,875
I only need to pay
half the rent and utility bills,

78
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,209
so 60,000 should be more than enough.

79
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,046
Hey, not a problem.

80
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,798
But I’ll only have a little left over.

81
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,800
And I’ll have to survive
another month with that amount.

82
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,263
Now I’ve gone past being scared.
I’m beginning to feel depressed.

83
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,308
Nana-chan.

84
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,101
You can go on your lunch break.

85
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,854
Oh, it’s okay. I’ll be skipping
my lunches for a while.

86
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,731
Huh? Why’s that?

87
00:05:56,814 --> 00:06:00,735
Well… I’ve decided to go on a diet.

88
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,031
So that’s why you’re looking
under the weather today.

89
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,743
Brighten up, Hachi.
But that’s unfortunate.

90
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,329
It wouldn’t be proper to invite you
out at such a time.

91
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,373
I wanted to take you to dinner.

92
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,378
Yay! Food!

93
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,094
All right. We’ll close early today.

94
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,930
Think about what you wanna eat.

95
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,223
Darn it.

96
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,350
But it’s okay, I guess.

97
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,310
It's no big deal to have a meal together.

98
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,063
After all, it’s not as if Mr. Mizukoshi
has the hots for me.

99
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,315
So this doesn’t qualify
as cheating on my boyfriend.

100
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,447
I was waiting for you this whole time.

101
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,366
I’m really sorry about that.

102
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,576
So, how about next Sunday?

103
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,786
I think I can make it.

104
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,162
That's great!

105
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,957
Oh, right. About yesterday…

106
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,999
Huh? What?

107
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,586
What are you saying? That’s crazy!

108
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,880
But it’s the truth!

109
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,299
I really think you should pick
your friends more carefully.

110
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,552
But like I said,
she’s usually a really good girl.

111
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,387
I don’t believe that.

112
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,348
Ow!

113
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,392
Yo!

114
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,107
I get it.

115
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,152
Well, I was just as surprised.

116
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,155
You have the same employer,
go to the same university,

117
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,031
and are enrolled in the same faculty.

118
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,159
Guess you pretty much have to get along.

119
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,369
Yes, but Sachiko was accepted
on her first try,

120
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,620
so she’s two years younger.

121
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,538
Sachiko?

122
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,000
I can’t help it.
She asked me to call her that.

123
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,460
There was no reason to refuse.

124
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:45,047
She’s clearly your type,
petite and fair-skinned.

125
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,174
You can’t help it.

126
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,633
But I’m telling you, it’s not like that!

127
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,845
I’m proud that you’re holding back.

128
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:51,971
She’s back.

129
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,185
Here, Shoji. Is coffee okay?

130
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,811
Yeah. Thanks.

131
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,689
Mr. Kyosuke, which would you prefer?

132
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,400
Just call me Kyosuke, Sa-chan.

133
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,033
That’s gonna be trouble.

134
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,201
Huh?

135
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:18,873
Well, I’m more for the dark-skinned
big girls like you, but…

136
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:22,043
Huh? Well, excuse me for my dark skin.

137
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:26,881
But even I find her cute.
This is definitely bad.

138
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,515
So cool!

139
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,686
Shin, I didn’t notice you there.

140
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,687
Awesome.

141
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,605
I never knew you could play
the drums too, Nana.

142
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,525
-I can’t.
-But you were!

143
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,318
This is all I know.

144
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,988
But you’re good. When did you learn?

145
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,450
Back home while I was in a band,
I learned it for fun.

146
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,785
From Yasu?

147
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,663
Why do you know about Yasu?

148
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,375
Because when Nobu gets drunk,
he always talks about Yasu.

149
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,920
Last night too, he kept saying
how he wished that Yasu was here.

150
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,590
You stayed over at Nobu’s place again?

151
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,966
Those are Nobu’s clothes, aren’t they?

152
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,803
Nobu’s at work right now
and said he may be a bit late.

153
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,765
Shin, you should return home
once in a while.

154
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,393
I’ll bet your parents are worried.

155
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,854
They’re not.

156
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,732
Really? Then it’s fine, I guess.

157
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,322
You’re different, Nana.

158
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,364
Usually, everyone says,

159
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,492
"You’re mistaken.
Of course they’re worried."

160
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:24,040
But it’s a fact that there are parents
who abandon their children.

161
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,130
A junior high student?

162
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,300
That guy who came by the store
about the bassist ad, right?

163
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,968
Didn’t he say he was eighteen?

164
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,678
Actually, he’s fifteen.

165
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,056
Nana cornered him with a few questions,
and he confessed.

166
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,058
He told us he thought
they wouldn’t take him seriously

167
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,060
if he said he was a junior high student.

168
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,979
Oh, but it’s April,
so maybe he’s in tenth grade now.

169
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,648
Although he doesn’t seem
to be going to high school.

170
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,108
Oh? Maybe he didn’t bother
taking the entrance exams.

171
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,236
Hmm… I really don’t know.

172
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,989
He doesn’t go into detail
about such things.

173
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,908
There seems to be more to it
under the surface.

174
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,117
Mm-hmm.

175
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:05,748
Anyway, he doesn’t go home much,
so I’m somewhat concerned.

176
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,709
I’m sure his parents are totally worried.

177
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,045
I guess so.

178
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,297
And we still haven’t found a drummer.

179
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,508
It’s like our luck’s running out.

180
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,427
But didn’t you say there was
a guy who tried out?

181
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,846
Nana turned him down,
saying she didn’t like him.

182
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,933
Although the others said
he was pretty good.

183
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,686
Really? She must have high standards.

184
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,690
Or rather, I think she’s in love with Yasu

185
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,567
and therefore refuses to accept
a different drummer.

186
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,152
Who is Yasu?

187
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,154
He was her band’s leader back
in her hometown.

188
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,657
He’s a skinhead,
and he and Nana look so cute together.

189
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,451
I can just imagine.

190
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,788
Hey, Mr. Mizukoshi, is it okay
if I order the meat and potato dish, too?

191
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,164
Go ahead.

192
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,918
I’m so full!

193
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,878
This is happiness!

194
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,966
That’s great. But was the tavern
really okay for you?

195
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,427
Yup! I love taverns.

196
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,970
Thank you for the meal.

197
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,847
Nana!

198
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,308
Are you all right?

199
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,853
I think I might’ve had
a little too much to drink.

200
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,521
How embarrassing.

201
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,987
Oops!

202
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,866
-Well, I should be going now.
-Wait, Nana!

203
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:28,038
To be honest, I asked you out today

204
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,166
because I wanted to talk to you
about something important.

205
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,835
Huh? Wait a minute.

206
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,130
I’ve been waiting for the right time,

207
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,924
but I just couldn’t bring myself
to tell you.

208
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,636
This could come as a surprise to you.

209
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,306
This is too sudden.

210
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,810
I’m well aware what I’m
about to say will trouble you, Nana.

211
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,688
I’m not ready for this.

212
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,149
Mr. Mizukoshi…

213
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,740
You see… I…

214
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,792
I’ve been waiting for the right time,

215
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,544
but I just couldn’t bring myself
to tell you.

216
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,798
This could come as a surprise to you.

217
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,551
This is too sudden.

218
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,514
I’m well aware what I’m
about to say will trouble you, Nana.

219
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,016
I’m not ready for this.

220
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,936
Mr. Mizukoshi…

221
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,357
You see, I plan on closing the shop.

222
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,865
I’m sorry. Business isn’t going well.

223
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,457
This is real trouble!

224
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,012
Oh! My shoe!

225
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,890
-Shoji!
-Huh?

226
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,143
Sorry, Shoji. Go on ahead.
You’ll miss the last train!

227
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,311
Hey!

228
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,505
You knew you would have to run
for the last train,

229
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,049
so why did you wear those shoes?

230
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,857
I did it on purpose.

231
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,994
NANA

232
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,209
Hello?

233
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,712
Shoji!

234
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,590
Help me!

235
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,937
This is for the taxi.

236
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,273
It's all right.
It’s on my way home anyway.

237
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,193
But it was my fault
we missed the last train.

238
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,611
It really is okay.

239
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:56,538
Shoji, that call earlier…
It was from your girlfriend, right?

240
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,507
It’s my policy not to accept money
from a guy who has a girlfriend.

241
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,809
Good night.

242
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:40,165
It appears that this is
all the money I have right now.

243
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,586
Why? You’re always working so hard.

244
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,714
You really are spending it all on Sachiko!

245
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,591
You’re wrong! In fact, I bought that!

246
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,972
A computer. And it’s a Mac.

247
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:59,435
Nice, isn’t it? I’m studying
computer graphic design, after all.

248
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,436
I wonder if we can get
a good price for it.

249
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,353
Cut it out!

250
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,732
But how else am I gonna get
proper food starting tomorrow?

251
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,026
All right! I’ll share this with you.

252
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,111
Pickled plums made by my grandma.

253
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,283
Shoji, you idiot! You’re of no use!

254
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,539
So, now that I was unemployed, I was lost,

255
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:25,461
seriously contemplating the possibility
of starving to death on the streets.

256
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,380
Thank you for choosing Shuei Bank…

257
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,798
300,000 yen?

258
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:30,716
That’s right!

259
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,094
Mr. Mizukoshi deposited
300,000 yen in severance pay!

260
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,555
Are you sure you that’s not 30,000?

261
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,183
Your remaining salary would’ve
amounted to around that much.

262
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,268
Then do you think this 300,000 yen
is to sever his relationship with me?

263
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,312
Did you sleep with Mizukoshi?

264
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,022
-No way!
-You're lying!

265
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,441
Why would he give you
that much if you didn’t?

266
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,942
It’s not a lie!

267
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,861
Mr. Mizukoshi is returning to his hometown

268
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,196
and will be getting married.

269
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,656
I feel that I’ve been deceived.

270
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,866
-You idiot.
-Huh?

271
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,745
The one who deposited
the 300,000 yen wasn’t Mizukoshi.

272
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,163
Take a closer look.

273
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,289
BANK TRANSACTION DETAILS

274
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,125
Natsuko Komatsu. That’s my mom!

275
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,877
You’re a long way from independence

276
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,629
if you’re crying to your parents
for money.

277
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,800
Huh? But I didn’t tell her
I was having money problems!

278
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,928
I thought if I told them,
they would make me go back home.

279
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,099
How did she know?

280
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,976
Could it be maternal instinct?

281
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:30,818
Oh, right.

282
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:34,905
Hey, Nana. Now that I have all this money,
let’s celebrate with sukiyaki tonight.

283
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:35,989
Huh?

284
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,783
Back home, my mom would make sukiyaki

285
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,368
when we had something to celebrate.

286
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,120
Let’s go back to the supermarket
to buy what we need.

287
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,037
You…

288
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,498
You’re unemployed!
What is there to celebrate about?

289
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,999
The fact that I got money…

290
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:46,917
Don’t celebrate!

291
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,794
Be remorseful for the money you’ve wasted!

292
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,922
We’re having natto soybeans
tonight as planned.

293
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,008
You’re not eating any meat
until you find a job.

294
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,469
No way!

295
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:06,478
Say, shouldn’t you call Natsuko
and thank her?

296
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,189
I’ll do it later.

297
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,025
Oh, I see. If you call now,
you’d be embarrassed

298
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,944
because you’ll cry the moment
you hear mommy’s voice.

299
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,445
Well, sure.

300
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,740
You get homesick too, sometimes,
don’t you Nana?

301
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,327
No. Since I don’t have a home.

302
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,249
There you go, trying to be cool again.

303
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,779
Tonight calls for sukiyaki after all!

304
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:15,005
Yasu, Blast is the band you started.

305
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,593
Yeah. I was so worried
I couldn’t sleep at night.

306
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:24,556
Besides, there are law firms in Tokyo too.

307
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,705
Hey, Nana…

308
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:54,503
Do you still think that
you don’t have a home anywhere?

309
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:01,468
This dinner table by the window,
and the chairs…

310
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:06,139
They’re still there,
just as they were back then.
