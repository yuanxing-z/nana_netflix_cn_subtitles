GRADE 1, CLASS 3 NANA KOMATSU

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,422
I am straying from the subject,
but please bear with me.

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,841
Ever since I was a child,

4
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:12,137
my dream was to become a beautiful bride.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,974
There was really nothing else
that I truly wanted to be.

WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

7
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:43,978
Wedding funds?

8
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,230
That’s right.

9
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,900
Listen, a wedding is a major event,
so it will cost a lot of money.

10
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,611
So I had been saving up money
for that special day.

11
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:55,865
It’s not easy for a parent
with three daughters, you know.

12
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,700
So why are you suddenly depositing
such important funds

13
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,119
into my account?

14
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,247
-Well, you eloped, didn’t you?
-Huh?

15
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,456
I’m home.

16
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,874
Hey, Nami.

17
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,168
-Where have you been until this hour?
-Mom!

18
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,420
-I was at, like, a karaoke bar.
-Mom?

19
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,421
Can’t you at least call

20
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,340
-if you’re gonna be late?
-Mom!

21
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,883
Hello, Nana?

22
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,677
Mom, what makes you think I eloped?

23
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,096
-Hello, Sis?
-Nami?

24
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:21,224
How are you?
How’s life in Tokyo treating you?

25
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,809
How are things with your boyfriend?

26
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,269
Nami! It’s you, isn’t it?

27
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,312
You’re the one giving Mom
strange ideas, aren’t you?

28
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,856
What? Not really.

29
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,484
All I said was you had gone
to Tokyo to live with a guy.

30
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,485
You’re wrong!

31
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,029
There’s no need to hide it. I envy you.

32
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,823
You get to have sex every day, right?

33
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,827
Goodness, watch your language!

34
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,495
Go and take a bath.

35
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,956
Huh? But I wanna talk some more.

36
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:50,253
-I took a bath already. Where? That hurt!
-Young girls today will talk about s-- sex

37
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,630
-in front of their parents?
-You kicked me!

38
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,965
Hello, Nana?

39
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,634
-Anyway, you’re legally an adult now,
-This sucks. I should’ve

40
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,011
-so do whatever you wish
-applied to a university

41
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,178
-with that money.
-…in Tokyo, too.

42
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,847
Just don’t get divorced
and come running home.

43
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,015
D-- Divorced?

44
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,268
Don’t cause me any more trouble
than you already have. Bye.

45
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,024
Mom?

46
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,946
This is no laughing matter!

47
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,990
I thought she would ask me to return home
because she was worried.

48
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,159
But don’t come running home?
What parent would say that?

49
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,952
I'm not even married yet!

50
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,580
Way to go, Natsuko! What a cool mother!

51
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,709
-Are you drunk, Nana?
-No, I’m not drunk.

52
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,336
Why even ask?

53
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,839
I’m back. I bought you cigarettes, Nana.

54
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,217
Yasu! Welcome back!

55
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,637
You’ve had a few, I see.

56
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,931
I love you!

57
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,849
I get it. So don’t jump on me.

58
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,644
-Wh-- What about Nobu and Shin?
-Yeah.

59
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:51,481
Nobu passed out on the sidewalk,
so Shin took him home.

60
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,984
I-- I see.
Nobu was drinking a lot after all.

61
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,779
That Shin…
Surprisingly, he doesn’t get drunk.

62
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,280
Is it only water to him?

63
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,573
Don’t fall asleep.

64
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,701
Give me a break.

65
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,536
Let's go.

66
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,041
Oh my, Nana.

67
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:14,712
It’s the first time I saw Nana
with her guard down and drunk like that.

68
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,381
How cute.

69
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,801
She must be really happy that Yasu came.

70
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,512
She even kissed him
in the midst of things.

71
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,597
And on top of that, telling him
"I love you"?

72
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,058
But it wasn’t as if Yasu was
at all surprised by it.

73
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,769
Those two could be dating, after all.

74
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,023
What are they doing with the door open?

75
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,568
Oh, sorry, Nana.

76
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,321
Having you clean up all by yourself.
Let me help you.

77
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,907
It’s okay. I just have to rinse.

78
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,118
Then give me a towel.
I’ll wipe the dishes.

79
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,461
Yasu is a great guy.

80
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,798
He doesn’t look it,
but he’s kind, considerate, and reliable,

81
00:04:58,881 --> 00:04:59,757
and he doesn’t brag.

82
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,467
And he’s a lawyer too.

83
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,595
If I were to marry someone,
I’d prefer a guy like him.

84
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:08,308
What am I thinking? Yasu belongs to Nana.

85
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,144
Come to think of it, I have Shoji.

86
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,353
Oh, are you done?

87
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:16,566
Thanks for doing the dishes.
I’ll be on my way.

88
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,817
Huh?

89
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,612
Thanks for the meal.

90
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,822
Where are you going?

91
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,326
I think I’ll stay in a hotel
until I find my own place.

92
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,537
Shin’s at Nobu’s place,
so it’s kinda crowded there.

93
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,331
Why not stay here?

94
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,500
Huh? Thank you.
But I’ll have to decline the offer.

95
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,711
There’s no reason to decline!

96
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:41,174
Yeah, but it wouldn’t be right.
Good night.

97
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,177
Why?

98
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,806
I don't understand.

99
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,769
Although she was drunk,
Nana was being so sweet.

100
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,521
Why is Yasu always so stoic?

101
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,024
Could he have a girlfriend back home?

102
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:01,861
Playing in a band and all,
he’s probably popular with the women.

103
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,865
Still, even if he does have
a girlfriend back home,

104
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:09,577
she can’t be that important to him
since he left her to come here.

105
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,958
Shoji left me, too!

106
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,589
But it’s not the same with Shoji.

107
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,675
He’s always treated me with great care.

108
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:28,262
Besides, I’m here now
because he asked me to come.

109
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,974
No he didn't!
I decided on my own to come here!

110
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,602
Well, you eloped, didn’t you?

111
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,771
Just don’t get divorced
and come running home.

112
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,690
You’re wrong, Mom. I came here on my own.

113
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,651
Let’s live together, Nana.

114
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,570
It’s all right. Calm down.
Shoji said that to me.

115
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,990
If I wanted to marry,
he’d accept me as his bride anytime.

116
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,244
I wonder…

117
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:57,125
Living together and getting married
are somewhat different, I think.

118
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,377
Besides, Shoji just started
studying at the university,

119
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,295
so he won’t graduate
for another four years.

120
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,174
And he’s just as broke as I am.

121
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,344
A wedding is a major event,
so it will cost a lot of money.

122
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:11,431
Mom's right. I’m not interested
in a cheap wedding.

123
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,724
I wanna wear two types of wedding dresses.

124
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,768
I don’t wanna live
in low-income housing or a studio flat.

125
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,603
If possible, a home with a yard.

126
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,564
Or at least, a brand new condominium.

127
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,898
I have to save money!

128
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:21,607
EMPLOYMENT MAGAZINE

129
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,943
I'll try not to use
the 300,000 yen from Mom

130
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,027
and will try to keep it
in my bank account.

131
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,779
And I’ll save more on my own, too.

132
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,614
If I keep at it,
I should have saved up enough

133
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,699
by the time Shoji graduates
from university.

134
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,616
Shoji!

135
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,035
I’ll get that house with a yard, Shoji.
Leave it to me.

136
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,373
My head hurts!

137
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:42,211
Shit. I shouldn’t have agreed
to work today.

138
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:47,758
Hachi! Medicine!

139
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,722
Hachi! Aren’t you home?

140
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,684
Oh, good morning, Nana.

141
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,561
What’s with that outfit?

142
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,938
I have a job interview today.

143
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,690
I gave them a call,
and they told me to come right away.

144
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,775
How do I look? Will this do?

145
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,571
-Work? What kind?
-A publisher.

146
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,906
What?

147
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,742
Are you all right?
Do you have a hangover, Nana?

148
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,785
I’ve got some medicine for that.

149
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,122
A publisher?

150
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,291
Can someone like you
get into a place like that?

151
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,460
But I do meet their conditions to apply.

152
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,962
The ad says they're looking
for someone who can do errands.

153
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,173
Besides, it’s a small company
I’ve never heard of,

154
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,716
so I’m sure it’ll be fine.

155
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:29,675
You sure about that?

156
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,594
I hope this place isn’t going
bankrupt anytime soon.

157
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,638
Let me get you some water.

158
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,265
"Let me get you," she says.

159
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,352
She’s even changed her speech pattern
to match her outfit.

160
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,688
But why a publisher, suddenly?

161
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,024
I just happened to come across it
in the classifieds.

162
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,235
The salary’s good,
and I get two days off every week.

163
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:51,030
Also, since I’m living in Tokyo,
I’d like to commute to downtown.

164
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,449
Doesn’t working for a publisher
sound super cool?

165
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,576
It has the ring of a successful woman.

166
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,621
Ring of a successful woman?

167
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:03,334
But I am glad you’ve decided
to look for your next job.

168
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,169
I thought you saying you wanted
to live on your own

169
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,088
was all talk and no action.

170
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,257
But now I see you were serious.

171
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,218
Well, not really.

172
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:16,138
The only reason I decided to work
is simply because I want money.

173
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,015
But regardless of what
my true intentions are,

174
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,726
if I get into a good company
and work hard,

175
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,145
it’ll eventually give me the skills
and ability to live on my own.

176
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,230
That’s killing two birds with one stone.

177
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,481
By the way, where’s Yasu?

178
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:31,112
Yasu said he’ll be staying at a hotel
until he finds a place to live, then left.

179
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,239
-I tried to stop him, but…
-Is that so?

180
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,533
"Is that so?"

181
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,451
I’ll be going now.

182
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,039
We’ll be practicing
at the usual studio tonight.

183
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,585
-Can you make it, Hachi?
-Mm-hmm. I have no plans this evening.

184
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,961
Then come!

185
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,921
From tonight,
Yasu will be playing the drums,

186
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,591
so it’s gonna be far better
than anything you’ve heard.

187
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,217
Sure!

188
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,431
That Nana. She really is in a good mood.

189
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,058
Her good mood is rubbing off on me.
It's making me excited.

190
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,437
But yeah, now they have
all the band members they need.

191
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,732
All they have to do now is head
toward their dreams full force.

192
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,152
All right! I’ll do my best, too!

193
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,826
Shoji!

194
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,455
Hey, Junko! Long time no see.

195
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,041
Well, yeah. It’s the first time
I’ve run into you on campus.

196
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,168
Are you coming to school like you should?

197
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:30,087
That’s not nice.
I'm seriously attending classes.

198
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,090
Shoji. I’ll go on ahead.
Should I cover for you?

199
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,593
Ah, sure. Well… no.

200
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,638
Which is it? Make up your mind, will ya?

201
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,722
Use your wise judgment!

202
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,140
All right.

203
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,853
-So is that the rumored Sachiko?
-No! Ah, what’s this about a rumor?

204
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:49,649
Wow. You’re totally freaking out.
That makes you all the more suspicious.

205
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,069
Give me a break! That Kyosuke.
Telling Junko, of all people…

206
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,988
Let that guy from Kansai
cover for you in class.

207
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,741
In the meantime, you will give me details.

208
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,495
Matsuda.

209
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,456
Have you seen Shoji today? Is he not here?

210
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,250
No. We were together until a moment ago,

211
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,920
but we bumped into a girl he knew.

212
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,047
They wanted to talk, so I left.

213
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:14,799
Oh?

214
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:19,136
It's not like that.
I doubt that was his girlfriend.

215
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,596
Don’t worry.

216
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:25,476
Matsuda, I don’t have
special feelings for Shoji.

217
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,811
We’re just good friends.

218
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:31,190
What are you saying?
It’s more than obvious.

219
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:35,361
You know, at first,
I thought you two were dating.

220
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:39,448
I was really surprised
when I heard that Shoji has a girlfriend.

221
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,369
I didn’t know either until recently.

222
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,162
To be honest, I was a bit surprised.

223
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,623
What do you mean? Was he hiding it?

224
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,917
-He’s the worst!
-That’s not it!

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,253
I assumed on my own that
he didn’t have one!

226
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,380
Don’t cover for him. You’re so sweet.

227
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,340
Come on, have a seat, Sachiko.

228
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,009
Forget about Shoji and go out with me.

229
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,262
Sorry, but I’m not attending this class.

230
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,265
Besides, you have a girlfriend back home,
don’t you?

231
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,266
Shoji told me.

232
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,602
That guy. Going around disclosing
other people’s secrets and not his.

233
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,271
I’ll get you for this, Shoji.

234
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,857
You really are the worst!

235
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,608
I have lost all respect for you!

236
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,862
I just didn’t get a chance
to talk about it.

237
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,823
-I wasn’t necessarily hiding it.
-Don’t make excuses!

238
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,784
You were planning on two-timing them,
weren't you?

239
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,620
Junko! Do you think I’m capable
of doing something like that?

240
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,415
Of course not!

241
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:33,502
Yet you got greedy and ended up
breaking somebody's heart.

242
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,546
Do you think… she’s hurt?

243
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:39,717
Of course she’s hurt!
Sachiko’s in love with you, right?

244
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,053
But maybe I’m just hoping that she is.

245
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,764
She hasn’t actually told me
that she likes me.

246
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,183
And nothing has changed since.

247
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,393
We still continue seeing each other
as no more than friends.

248
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:53,063
Your intellectual level has remained
the same since junior high.

249
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:57,067
-This is nonsense!
-Junko! Don’t talk to me like that!

250
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,320
What should I do to make things right?

251
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,448
You have to put an end to this.

252
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,742
If you keep spending time with her,

253
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,036
you’ll continue hurting her
until it becomes unbearable.

254
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:12,082
But we attend the same classes,
and we work at the same workplace.

255
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,667
How am I supposed to put an end to it?

256
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,045
Actually, before you
concern yourself with Sachiko,

257
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,547
shouldn’t you be thinking
about Nana instead?

258
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,715
Huh?

259
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,675
So Sachiko’s more important
to you than Nana.

260
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,177
That’s not true!

261
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,138
I haven’t done anything that
needs explaining to Nana.

262
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,808
But Nana seems to suspect you and Sachiko.

263
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,812
-Huh?
-I heard her mumbling about Sachiko.

264
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,898
She said something about her working
for her Demon Lord or something.

265
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,984
Oh. You’ve got it wrong.
That’s the virtual Sachiko.

266
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,403
Huh? What do you mean, virtual Sachiko?

267
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,199
I have no idea. In fact, I’d like to know.

268
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,992
You know, Shoji,

269
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,578
I can perfectly understand that
you’re exhausted being with Nana,

270
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,580
and you look for comfort through Sachiko.

271
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,376
-Comfort?
-That’s it, Junko. That’s exactly it.

272
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,836
I feel comfort whenever I’m with Sachiko.

273
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,881
But you knew that Nana’s
an exhausting woman in that way

274
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,508
and still you went after her.

275
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,385
So don’t run away now.
Diligently stick with her!

276
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,719
Of course, that’s what I intend to do!

277
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,306
I’m committed in this relationship
enough to make Nana my wife.

278
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,016
Eventually, I wanna share
a grave with her.

279
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,810
You’re taking this too far.

280
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,852
You’ll never rest in peace

281
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,938
if you die with that believer
of the Demon Lord.

282
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,733
Junko! Whose side are you on?

283
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:24,196
Neither really.
You could say I’m on the side of justice.

284
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,285
What does she mean, justice?
She’s making fun of me.

285
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,286
This coming from a former delinquent.

286
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,372
One day, I’m gonna show everyone
pictures of you from junior high.

287
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,723
Why are you here?

288
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,518
Shoji… Thank goodness.
I was looking for you.

289
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,061
Here’s the book I borrowed.

290
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,230
I wanted to hurry and return it to you.

291
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,690
Thank you very much.

292
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,109
Oh. Anytime would’ve been fine.

293
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,193
You could’ve even given it to me at work.

294
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,487
You’re right. I’m sorry.

295
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,448
No, there’s no need to apologize.

296
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,371
So, how long have you been standing here?

297
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,583
I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to eavesdrop,

298
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:21,420
but given the content
of the conversation, I just froze.

299
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,213
Never mind that!
How long have you been here?

300
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,257
Of course she’s hurt!

301
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,426
Sachiko’s in love with you, right?

302
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,513
Shoji! I’m sorry. Are you all right?

303
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,016
Ah, yeah. Just so we’re clear,

304
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,393
I didn’t stumble like that to try
and make you laugh or anything.

305
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,312
I’m really sorry.

306
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,398
No, Sach… you don’t have to apologize.

307
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,275
I’m the one at fault.

308
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,195
I’m at fault! Bye!

309
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,032
This is bad. This is worse than bad.
What am I gonna do?

310
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,327
I have to think this through seriously.

311
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,621
If you keep spending time with her,

312
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,957
you’ll continue hurting her
until it becomes unbearable.

313
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,541
But it would be cowardly

314
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,669
to run away from it like this,
right, Koichi Sato?

315
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,338
-Huh?
-Nothing. I’m talking to myself.

316
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,424
What do you mean?
After calling a person by his full name.

317
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,385
Besides, Shoji,
I thought you had class today.

318
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,971
If you’re already cutting class
to come here and drink at this early hour,

319
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,806
I’d say your future isn’t looking
too good.

320
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:17,685
That’s right.
What am I doing here at Jackson’s?

321
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,604
I see. So this is what escaping
from one’s troubles is like.

322
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,440
Then I’m already running away.

323
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,490
So Sachiko’s more important
to you than Nana.

324
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,909
You’re wrong!

325
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,120
Koichi Sato, I’m going to work!

326
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,497
I’m gonna break ties with her!

327
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,001
I'll do whatever it takes
to be with Nana forever.

328
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,174
Ever since I first met her,

329
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,011
I was planning not to hang out
with her much.

330
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,848
So what am I doing,
feeling comforted by her?

331
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,226
That’s exactly what the Demon Lord wants.

332
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,853
It won’t happen.

333
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,329
I definitely won’t betray Nana.

334
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:26,045
Why are you changing into your sneakers,
Ms. Kawamura?

335
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,672
Because I have to run for the last train.

336
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,841
Right. That makes sense.

337
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,226
-Sorry to keep you. Let’s hurry.
-Wait, Sachiko!

338
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:43,729
I have to talk to you about something.

339
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,449
Don’t make such a face.
I won’t look at her face.

340
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,702
I’ll talk as we walk,
so will you please listen?

341
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,914
If we miss the last train,
I’ll pay for a taxi.

342
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,893
So, how am I supposed to end this?

343
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,145
What am I supposed to tell her? How?

344
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,064
She’s my friend
and not my girlfriend to start with.

345
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,525
So asking her to break up with me
would be odd.

346
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,984
Do I say we’re no longer friends?

347
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,986
But why should I have to say that?

348
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,239
Sachiko hasn’t done anything wrong.

349
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,367
Or rather, she’s a really great girl.

350
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,077
What am I doing?

351
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,788
Anyway, I must say something.

352
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:43,705
You know…

353
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:01,223
-Sorry. I’m really sorry.
-You’ve done nothing wrong, Shoji.

354
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,894
I jumped to conclusions on my own
and got carried away.

355
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:11,775
I will be careful not to interfere.

356
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:17,281
I will never interfere
in your relationship with your girlfriend.

357
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:24,288
So… please… Can’t we at least be friends?

358
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,082
Don’t ask me to end this.

359
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,891
That’s strange.

360
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,058
Huh?

361
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:48,687
Shoji should be done with work,
but I get his answering machine.

362
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,522
Did he forget to turn his phone on?

363
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,609
I want to hurry and tell him
that I got a new job.

364
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,319
He’s probably cheating on you.

365
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,655
Shoji wouldn’t do such a thing!
I’ll send him an email.

366
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:03,243
I wonder what kind of company would hire
a woman like you…

367
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,120
They must really be understaffed.

368
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,040
But you know, I’ll learn the job
while doing errands,

369
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:11,001
and if I am fully capable,
they’ll hire me permanently.

370
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,295
So I’ll do my best.

371
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,881
Wow. You seem awfully motivated.

372
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:19,009
If I work hard, I will get a bonus,

373
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,970
which will get me a step closer
to buying a house with a yard.

374
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,641
A house with a yard? Is that your dream?

375
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,267
Yup! A great big dream!

376
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,147
Then I’ll build you a home
with the money I get from my songs.

377
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,857
Huh?

378
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,237
But your room will be the doghouse.

379
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,742
If Nana was a guy,

380
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,745
she would be the love of my life.

381
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:51,375
Back then, I often thought that.

382
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,419
However, if that were the case,

383
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:58,507
I doubt we would’ve been left
with only happy memories.

384
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,386
Because love and pain go hand in hand.

385
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,140
The deeper you fall,
the more painful it gets.
