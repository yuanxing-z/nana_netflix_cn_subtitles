1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,546
The next time I fall in love,

2
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:07,090
I’d prefer a guy who’s a bit coldhearted.

3
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:13,430
He doesn’t have to listen
to my selfish desires.

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:17,142
However, on the day
after we have a quarrel,

5
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:21,563
he’ll give me a single flower
and a couple words of love.

6
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:23,022
That kind of guy.

7
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:39,748
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

8
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,889
I’m so excited I can’t sleep.

9
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,898
It seems like such a long time ago
that we went to the Trapnest concert.

10
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,574
Damn! I kept looking at Ren
and forgot to look at Takumi.

11
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,079
Takumi…

12
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,543
Oh, well. What’s done is done.

13
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:54,215
It’s been at least two hours
since Nana left.

14
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,633
But knowing Nana…

15
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,511
One day, we’ll be better than Trapnest!
Good riddance!

16
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,139
Let me see you try.

17
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,892
I was thinking,

18
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:09,272
what if she bluntly declares
a rivalry and quickly returned home?

19
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,900
But I’m sure things are going well.

20
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,485
I hope things go well.

21
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,573
Since we came into this world as women,

22
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,993
let’s be happy as women, Nana.

23
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,800
Nana!

24
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:45,099
I have no intention
of getting back together with you!

25
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,395
What are you doing?
These roses must’ve been expensive.

26
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,065
What’s with the stingy comments?
You’re Trapnest’s guitarist.

27
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,776
Flowers wither after a little time anyway,

28
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,405
so I’m making good use of them
while they still have value.

29
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,865
Not a story I prefer.

30
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,618
But you won’t wither, Ren!

31
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,667
In any case, look at this gorgeous room.

32
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,460
And you each get a room to yourself?

33
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,171
This is what they call
a "Suite Room," right?

34
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,508
Nope. "Deluxe Room."

35
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,304
It’s deluxe, all right,
especially this bath.

36
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,515
It’s unnecessarily too big.
I don’t feel comfortable.

37
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:13,146
Being here like this is
like going back in time.

38
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,857
We used to soak in the bathtub
every day like this

39
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,525
and talk about all kinds of stuff.

40
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:23,531
The bathroom in our room was small,
but it was comfortable, and I liked it.

41
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,951
Say, Ren, what are we gonna do
about that room?

42
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,787
Nobody’s living there, so it’s a waste.
You should clear it out.

43
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,833
It’s okay. That was my starting point.

44
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,711
One day, I’ll buy it,
return in my old age,

45
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,422
and quietly live there together with you.

46
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,800
Don’t make decisions for me
about when I get old.

47
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:47,388
When I was a kid,
that building was used for storage.

48
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,808
I would run away from that
shitty orphanage and go hide there.

49
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,896
I found a guitar and made it my own,
and I would play it there all night.

50
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,941
Regardless of whether you were born
with talent or not,

51
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,569
anyone could play well
after that much practice.

52
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,865
This is the first time you told me that.

53
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,367
I never told anyone.

54
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,079
I wanted people to think I was gifted.

55
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:23,466
You don’t have to wash me.
I took a bath just before I came here.

56
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:28,304
Old habits die hard.
But why are you so embarrassed?

57
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,223
I’m not embarrassed!

58
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,224
Like I’ve said many times,

59
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,476
I’m no longer on the pill,
so we’re not gonna do it in the bath.

60
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,978
-I know, I know.
-Do you, really?

61
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,617
-Ren…
-Hm?

62
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,994
That thing you said earlier. Is it true?

63
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,455
Which one?

64
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,708
Right now, I’m not about
to give up my pride,

65
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:01,754
so I can’t live with you like we used to.

66
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:07,593
But it would be nice if we could maybe
meet like this from time to time.

67
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,722
Hold each other and talk about each other.

68
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,310
And one day when we’re much older,

69
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,231
when I no longer care
about pride and recognition,

70
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,733
when I’ve grown tired of singing…

71
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:26,571
Then can I return to that home too?

72
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:35,455
That night, I had a dream.

73
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,916
I don’t remember what I dreamt,

74
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,296
but in that dream, I was wrapped
in feelings of warmth and happiness.

75
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:51,971
I woke up past noon and found Nana
there sleeping next to me.

76
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,394
I wonder if it would be okay to ask her.

77
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,104
I’m sure it would be okay.

78
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,107
She did say she’d tell me
anything if I ask.

79
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,317
Hey, Nana.

80
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,235
How’d it go with Ren?

81
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,865
I can’t answer anything you ask…

82
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,409
Huh? What? I don’t understand.

83
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,538
What I said was,

84
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,957
I can’t answer anything
when I’m brushing my teeth!

85
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,794
Really, you’re not too good
at figuring things out, Hachiko.

86
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,297
Well, I shouldn’t expect much.
You’re a dog, after all.

87
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,674
Come on, Nana.

88
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,134
Thanks for the meal.

89
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,178
There’s more miso soup, so just ask.

90
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,304
Thank you.

91
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,681
She didn't answer my question.

92
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,558
Liar!

93
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,435
And to think I was rooting for you so much

94
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,938
that I forgot to look at Takumi in person.

95
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,732
If I knew what was coming,
I would’ve only looked at Takumi.

96
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,276
Takumi!

97
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,694
Say, Hachiko…

98
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,906
I trust you, so I have a favor to ask.

99
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,866
You trust me?

100
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,660
Sure. What can I do for you?

101
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,623
If you do your job well,
I’ll give you a treat.

102
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,125
You did take good care of me
with this latest event after all.

103
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,545
What would you like? Beef jerky?

104
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,796
Takumi’s autograph!

105
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,880
Consider it done.

106
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,883
I will ask Ren for it.

107
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,303
All right!

108
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,347
Does a simple autograph
please you that much?

109
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,141
It’s not that! You and Ren are
back together, aren’t you?

110
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,645
W-- Well, I wouldn’t exactly… ah…

111
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,524
So what I’m asking,
since we don’t have a phone in our place…

112
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,527
Well, I do plan to buy a cell phone soon.

113
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,153
But in the meantime, should he need to,

114
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,947
I was hoping Ren could call you
on your cell…

115
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,826
So you want me to take Ren’s call and
relay his messages to you, right, Nana?

116
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:37,910
That’s right.

117
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,287
I’ll gladly do it.

118
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:44,000
Here’s Ren’s e-mail address,
so could you send him your address?

119
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,835
That’s great news, Nana.

120
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,129
-It’s not!
-Why not?

121
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:52,800
Why does it have to end up like this?
This isn’t what I intended.

122
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,261
I went to wrap things up with him.

123
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,889
My intentions were
to put an end to it all.

124
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,766
Why did I get carried away?

125
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,686
That’s so lame.

126
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,982
She said that while blushing
and curling up.

127
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,192
I had never seen her look so cute.

128
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:17,575
Geez… major adrenaline rush…

129
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,119
I want happiness as soon as possible too.

130
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,912
Or rather, a boyfriend.

131
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,831
Then we’ll organize a party.

132
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:28,336
Not that way.
I want a love that’s meant to be.

133
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,963
Oh, but now that you mention it,
a party might be good, too.

134
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,923
What the hell happened over there?

135
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,259
Don’t ask me. I’m on a top secret mission.

136
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,512
Top secret? Finding a boyfriend?

137
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,099
But meeting someone at a party
could also be a love meant to be.

138
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,976
You don’t have to do that.

139
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,270
You’ve got plenty of men blooming
right in your own garden.

140
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,813
-My garden?
-Good point.

141
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,149
Take the band members
of your roommate’s band, for instance.

142
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:53,653
They seem like great guys for a punk band.

143
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,197
Isn’t there anyone from
the band that you like?

144
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,368
No! For one thing, Yasu belongs to Nana!

145
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,911
Huh? Yasu?

146
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,829
Those two are an item?

147
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,414
But actually they’re not.

148
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,749
Now I’m confused.

149
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,919
Well, you see, Yasu’s really kind to Nana,

150
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,420
so I thought there were an item.

151
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,299
Right. But Yasu’s like that
to anyone, right?

152
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,259
Like he’s reached a higher spirit,
like a monk.

153
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,177
He is bald after all.

154
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,513
That’s right.

155
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:25,393
Yasu’s kind to Nobu
and Shin and to me too.

156
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,354
It’s true. Yasu’s like that with everyone.

157
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,898
He’s like an elder brother to me.

158
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,484
In addition,
since Nana doesn’t have a family,

159
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,779
Yasu must be thinking of Nana
as a real younger sister.

160
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:40,449
He must be feeling the need
to treat her better than a sister.

161
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,160
I see. It’s all becoming clearer.

162
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,079
Yasu’s a great guy.

163
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,288
-Right?
-Huh?

164
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,873
Listen when someone’s talking to you!

165
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,043
I was saying, I wasn't expecting
that among the band members

166
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,879
you'd bring up Yasu’s name.

167
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:54,922
Oh…

168
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,883
I thought you didn’t like guys like that,
with such a scary look.

169
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,219
Mm-hmm. But Yasu’s different.

170
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,512
Once you get used to the skinhead,

171
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:02,972
you accept it as a charming part
of his character.

172
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:07,935
Also, I basically prefer calm,
composed guys who are older than me.

173
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,895
You know that, right, Jun-chan?

174
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,772
And on that note, Yasu’s very mature.

175
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,899
-In addition, he’s a lawyer.
-That’s not part of it.

176
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,153
Take away his looks and his job,
and he’s still a great guy inside.

177
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,238
What? A great guy inside?

178
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,615
I never imagined that

179
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,159
I’d hear those words come out
of your mouth.

180
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,452
Great. Are you going for it?

181
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,370
Going where?

182
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,706
Wherever you need to.
Until you burn to ashes.

183
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,000
Junko, don’t lead her on.

184
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,586
We’re only talking about who
she’d prefer among those guys.

185
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,880
Th-- That’s right, Jun-chan!

186
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,757
She’s blushing. She’s blushing.

187
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,134
You seriously like him, by chance?

188
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:44,388
No way! I’ve never once thought
about Yasu and me getting together!

189
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,019
That’s right.

190
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,396
Nothing can happen between Yasu and me.

191
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,152
Oh, Nana. You’re here.

192
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,905
THUMP!

193
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,036
G-- Good evening.

194
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,288
Huh? Where is everyone? Not here yet?

195
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,999
Nana’s here, but she went out
to buy cigarettes.

196
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,000
I see.

197
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,377
What am I gonna do?

198
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,922
With Jun-chan bringing that subject up,
I can’t look at him the same way.

199
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:21,592
And it’s just us two here.
What are we gonna talk about?

200
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,473
Yasu. I brought this Trapnest pamphlet.
Wanna take a look?

201
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,516
Yeah, thanks.

202
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,476
Did you hear from either Nana or Ren?

203
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,686
Those two are safely back together.

204
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,147
Really? I’m happy about that.

205
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,608
Mm-hmm. I’m really happy about it.

206
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,985
I was a bit down lately,
but now I’m feeling really good.

207
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,531
Huh? You were a bit down?
But you looked fine.

208
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,158
Was something troubling you?

209
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,167
Ah, no. If you don’t wanna talk
about it, that’s okay.

210
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,213
My boyfriend cheated on me and dumped me.

211
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,682
He doesn’t realize what he lost.
What an idiot.

212
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,852
But I was the one who said
I no longer wanted Shoji.

213
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,898
The reason I used those foolish words,
"He dumped me,"

214
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,568
was because I wanted him
to be kind to me like this.

215
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,363
But I no longer want a kind man,

216
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,407
because it would hurt too much
when he betrays me.

217
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,413
Still, Yasu is very trustworthy.

218
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:37,626
If I frequently see him like this,
I might really fall for him.

219
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,879
Everyone’s late.

220
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,755
Would it be bad for me to fall
in love with him?

221
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,217
Where did Nana go to get cigarettes?

222
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,969
Should I not?

223
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,762
Why don’t I ask?

224
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,223
Say, Yasu, do you have a girlfriend?

225
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,934
Unfortunately, I’m not popular
with the women.

226
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,937
What? But I like you a lot!

227
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,190
Hey, Yasu!
Ren sent me a reply to my email.

228
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,152
He has a break in his tour schedule
on the seventh and eighth of next month,

229
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,695
so he’ll be returning here then.

230
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,072
He says if those days are fine with us,
we’ll have a mahjong tournament then.

231
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,198
Is that so?

232
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,242
What’s that? I wanna join you!

233
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,994
Huh? You know how to play mahjong, Hachi?

234
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,079
-I don’t, but…
-Good grief.

235
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,414
I wanna meet Ren too!

236
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,375
What? But Hachiko,
I thought you were into Takumi.

237
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,793
You cheater!

238
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,378
Don’t call me Hachiko.

239
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,923
Shin’s so not cute lately.

240
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,758
Where’s Nana?

241
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,510
Oh. She’s gone to Alaska
to buy cigarettes.

242
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,595
Alaska?

243
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,848
Oh, is that Trapnest’s pamphlet?
Let me see it.

244
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,184
Sure. Hachi brought it.

245
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,268
Oh, I wanna see it too.

246
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,896
Hachi? Even Yasu’s calling me that now.

247
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,983
Taking a close look like this,
Reira really is pretty.

248
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,694
Oh? Is she your type, Nobu?

249
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,696
I’m not sure about type, but she’s great.

250
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,448
Then next time let me introduce you

251
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,783
to a flight attendant
who looks just like her.

252
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,369
Huh? A flight attendant? Awesome!

253
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,495
She’s also really great at…

254
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,746
-Shin!
-Don't want her!

255
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,998
-I’m not gonna become your brother!
-Brother?

256
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,709
Oh, hi, Nana! You’re awfully late.

257
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,089
Shin! How old are you?

258
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,925
Stop smoking, you brat.
Stop trying to act cool.

259
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,720
What’s gotten into you all
of a sudden, Nana?

260
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,514
You were letting him until now.

261
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,724
She’s scaring me! Save me, Hachi.

262
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,687
Yasu!

263
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,065
Yes, I get it. No smoking, right?
I’ll comply.

264
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,566
No smoking? Why?

265
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,652
To increase my lung capacity.

266
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,321
Where you that impressed by Reira’s voice?

267
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:33,200
That bitch has nothing to do with it!
I’ll kill you, baldie!

268
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:37,454
Since that evening,
Nana even began doing sit-ups.

269
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,873
So I decided to workout with her.

270
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,293
Why are you doing sit-ups too?

271
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,131
I wanna have a slim waist
for when I find a boyfriend.

272
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,091
I see. Then good luck with your efforts.

273
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:53,095
I wonder if Yasu will notice me
if I work hard at it.

274
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,222
Maybe not.

275
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:59,101
I somehow can’t picture Yasu
falling in love with me.

276
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,894
Nana-dear, make copies of this.

277
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,273
I don’t think he sees me as a woman.

278
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,235
I get the same scent as that
of Mr. Mizukoshi.

279
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,947
My chances are slim.
Maybe I should give up.

280
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,576
I’m no longer at that age where
I can be satisfied with one-sided love.

281
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:19,455
Let’s look elsewhere, Nana-dear.
Perhaps a party is the way to go.

282
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:23,375
Oh, somebody, hold me tight.

283
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,213
An e-mail.

284
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,053
FROM REN
A MESSAGE FOR NANA

285
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,263
It’s come!

286
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:39,850
An email from Ren!

287
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,478
Trapnest's Ren has sent
an email to my cell phone!

288
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:46,106
I cannot believe something like this
is happening to a commoner like me!

289
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,193
It’s not addressed to me,
but can I read it?

290
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,986
Even if I shouldn’t, I wanna read it.

291
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,987
I’ll read it!

292
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:52,905
A MESSAGE FOR NANA

293
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,364
WE'RE PLAYING MAHJONG
AT NOBU'S PLACE ON THE NIGHT OF THE 7TH.

294
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,741
I'M FREE DURING THE DAY,
CAN I COME BY YOUR PLACE?

295
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,494
Yes, please come, darling.

296
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,288
That’s the reply I wrote.
So where’s my treat?

297
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,999
Don’t reply on my behalf!
You’re not getting a treat.

298
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,961
I want Takumi’s autograph! Nana, you liar!

299
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,380
Listen, if Ren’s dropping by your place,

300
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,466
why not have the mahjong tournament there?

301
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,510
My place is too small
for a large number of people.

302
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,552
I agree!

303
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,137
That’s fine,
but we don’t have a mahjong table.

304
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,182
I don’t either.
Just put a cloth over the table.

305
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,976
The table by the window?
But if we play sitting beside each other,

306
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,978
it won’t be much of a match
with everything visible to others.

307
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,022
We’ll move the table and sit around it.

308
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,649
-Don’t smoke!
-Oops!

309
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,608
I can’t wait!

310
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,609
JUNE 7TH
MAHJONG TOURNAMENT

311
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,611
I can't wait for the seventh!

312
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:37,241
Trapnest’s Ren is coming to our place.
Should I ask for his autograph?

313
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,827
If possible, we could have
a picture taken together?

314
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,286
What should I wear?

315
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,372
Should I buy that dress I wanted?

316
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,998
I should make an appointment
with the hairdresser too.

317
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,292
And I’ll prepare a bunch of food.

318
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,961
What should I make?

319
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,921
I should start preparing the night before.

320
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,589
I’ll get up early to clean up

321
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,092
and go to the flower shop,
so I can decorate the place with flowers…

322
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:58,387
Chief, I’m expecting
an important guest tomorrow.

323
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,972
May I take the day off from work?

324
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,223
Of course not!

325
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,182
THURSDAY, JUNE 7TH
4:30 PM

326
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,226
Thirty minutes before I get off work.

327
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,020
It’s about time people start arriving.

328
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,815
Oh, I wanna hurry back home and see Ren.

329
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,859
That’s right. I should buy some paper
for an autograph on my way home.

330
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,736
Please fire that girl, Chief!

331
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,696
Hmm…

332
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,574
Nana-dear, make copies of this. Huh?

333
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,410
Ms. Komatsu has left for the day.

334
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,120
She left early?

335
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,496
We should fire her!

336
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,581
I guess you’re right.

337
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,334
You know, you’re really strong.

338
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,627
Could you be a little easier on me?

339
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,129
But I am.

340
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,631
Shin, you’re being obnoxious.

341
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,133
I said, don’t smoke!

342
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,761
But Ren’s smoking.
So it’s okay for your own man to smoke.

343
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,638
You’re a typical woman after all, Nana.

344
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:45,475
Don’t you know there is a law that
says it’s illegal for minors to smoke?

345
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,103
But you had been smoking
ever since you were a minor.

346
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,772
So what’s this about no smoking now?

347
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,357
Those around you are bothered by it.

348
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:56,778
I don’t think it makes any difference.
There are many vocalists who smoke.

349
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,780
What you should do instead
is take some singing lessons.

350
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:02,201
Shut up! I don’t need you
giving me advice!

351
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,871
-Oh, could that be Hachi?
-It could be Hachi.

352
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,915
Off you go.

353
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,627
Hey, it’s not Hachi. It’s Nana.

354
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,961
You’re right.

355
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,297
How should I greet him?

356
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,882
"Pleased to meet you. I’m Nana."

357
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,800
No. "I’m Komatsu."

358
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,930
"I’ve been a big fan
since Trapnest’s debut!"

359
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,938
Welcome home, Nana.

360
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,699
Say, Nana…

361
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,452
I made her cry. What should I do?

362
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,581
That time, the reason my tears
suddenly came flowing out

363
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,833
was because I knew right away

364
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:56,171
that the dreamlike incident was
a treat you had arranged for me, Nana.

365
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,968
I felt more love than being thanked
a million times.

366
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,055
And that made me really happy.
