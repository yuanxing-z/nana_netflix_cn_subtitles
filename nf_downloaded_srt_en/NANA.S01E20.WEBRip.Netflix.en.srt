1
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:13,430
You’ve got plenty of men blooming
right in your own garden.

2
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:18,518
Oh, there’s much more to it
than being in full bloom.

3
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:35,744
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

4
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,450
Tsumo!

5
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,122
Six thousand all.

6
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,624
No way. Come on, give me a break.

7
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:09,337
Wow, this guy’s really strong.
Though his attitude sucks.

8
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,507
Shit. At least no one can beat me
in Shichi Narabe.

9
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,009
-Shichi Narabe?
-It’s popular now.

10
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,553
Among our band members, that is.

11
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,596
Every night during the tour,
we play Shichi Narabe.

12
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,892
It’s Naoki’s fault for bringing
a pack of cards along.

13
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,395
This isn’t some school field trip.

14
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,189
Shichi Narabe?

15
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,192
The Trapnest members play
that game every night?

16
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,578
I’m beginning to think that
Shichi Narabe is a really cool game.

17
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,205
And a game Ren’s excited about,
saying he won’t lose to anyone.

18
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,915
Is it fun? That Shichi Narabe?

19
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,041
Huh? You don’t know it?

20
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,503
How can you live life without running
into Shichi Narabe at some point?

21
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,881
I’d like to know too, Shin.

22
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,132
So do I.

23
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,093
Teach me how to play Shichi Narabe.
I’m getting tired of Mahjong.

24
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:00,597
Forget it! I’ve had enough
of Shichi Narabe!

25
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,683
Hey, Shin, what sort of life experience

26
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,852
have you had to be able
to mingle so easily with anyone?

27
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,938
You're already pals with them too.
You really are something.

28
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,608
Shin, if you’re tired of Mahjong,
switch with me.

29
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,735
I’ll switch with you. Where’s the toilet?

30
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,528
Over there.

31
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:21,200
So even Takumi goes to the toilet!
I’m surprised by the most trivial things.

32
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,162
Oh, no. There’s something wrong with me.

33
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:29,042
In person, Ren and Takumi were
a lot different from what I had imagined.

34
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,586
Trapnest hardly appears on TV,

35
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,504
so I could only judge them
from their songs and looks.

36
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,174
I had assumed them to be
a lot more laid-back and cooler.

37
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,719
Especially Takumi. He’s the band leader,

38
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:43,431
and he’s so serious
and composed in interviews.

39
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,476
How can I put it…
I had created this character

40
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,021
who was calm and composed
based on what I assumed of him.

41
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,774
But he’s more like
a friendly older brother.

42
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,784
These tomatoes are really delicious.

43
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,202
Where did you get them from?

44
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:10,541
J-- Jun-chan’s… ah, my friend’s family
grows them. She gave them to me.

45
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,460
Oh? That’s nice.

46
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,712
Tomatoes. Takumi likes tomatoes.

47
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,466
Would you like to take some with you?
There’s lots more.

48
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,384
Hmm…

49
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,054
I’d love to, but I can’t.

50
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,974
We’re back on tour
starting the day after tomorrow.

51
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,600
Oh yeah. The tour.

52
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,811
That live concert was really great.

53
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,647
I’m rooting for you.
I wish you the best of luck.

54
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,692
How cool!

55
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,823
Super cool!
He's a million times cooler in person.

56
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:47,287
What can I do? I can’t take this.
My body’s frozen.

57
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,835
-It must be Yasu.
-He’s finally here.

58
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,003
-What took him…
-Hachiko, get the door.

59
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,671
I’ll go.

60
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,761
Yasu, long time no see. How’ve you been?

61
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,848
Takumi, what are you doing here?

62
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:10,977
You're classmates?

63
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,771
Yeah, we went
to the same junior high school.

64
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:18,818
Although we really weren’t that close.
I didn’t even wanna get close to him.

65
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,321
-What?
-I never knew that either.

66
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,324
You’d always do stuff
that raised the question,

67
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,242
"As a human being,
should you be doing that?"

68
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,202
It’s amazing you never got sent
to juvenile prison.

69
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,872
Unlike you, I’m a delicate person.

70
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,874
Things were hard for me
during my childhood.

71
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:37,295
Then we went to different high schools
and started our own bands.

72
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,422
We’d meet at band competitions,

73
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,008
and it’s only after that
that we became friends.

74
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,927
It’s a small town after all.
Not only at concerts,

75
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,180
but we’d even bump into each other
at music studios.

76
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:50,099
Around that time, I used
to frequent live performances,

77
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,518
but I’d say Trapnest left
the strongest impression!

78
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,312
I was especially impressed
with the superb female singer!

79
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,689
-Just the singer?
-No!

80
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,024
The instrumentals too, of course.

81
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:01,652
Watch out, Nobu.
Takumi can become violent.

82
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,821
So Nobu’s a big fan of Reira.

83
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,449
Oh, really?
Then should I ask Reira to come?

84
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,992
Huh?

85
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:08,993
I’ll give her a call.

86
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,704
N-- No, but I’ll get
really nervous around her.

87
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,915
Besides, she doesn’t know
how to play mahjong.

88
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:14,957
Don’t call her.

89
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,376
Who cares if she doesn’t play mahjong?
I’d love to meet Reira.

90
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,753
Me too.

91
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,340
What about you, Yasu? Can we invite Reira?

92
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,385
It’s fine with me,
but I wonder if she’d wanna come.

93
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,680
Then I won’t tell her that you’re here.

94
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,598
Hey!

95
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,810
Wait a minute. What?
What was that all about?

96
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,729
Was there something going on
between you and Reira?

97
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,565
No, nothing. Don’t worry about it.

98
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,235
-You don’t know.
-I don’t. What is it?

99
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,907
She won’t pick up.
Tough luck, right, Yasu?

100
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,294
-These tomatoes are really delicious.
-Don’t change the subject!

101
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,672
What’s the big deal?
It’s all in the past now.

102
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,382
Yasu used to go out with Reira.

103
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,679
Wow! I don’t believe this!

104
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,141
Yasu and Ren,
you’ve both been hiding so much!

105
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,143
Once again, I feel totally left out.

106
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,521
Not intentionally. We just don’t talk
about everything that goes on.

107
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,022
You should!

108
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:24,235
But I went out with her way back
when Ren and I were in our old band.

109
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,529
We broke up before I even met you guys.

110
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,990
There’s no reason for me to tell you.

111
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,160
You really had a tough time with Reira.

112
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,661
Not something you’d wanna talk about.

113
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,581
What do you mean "a tough time"?
Stop adding to the truth.

114
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,916
But she always had her way with you.

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,461
That’s just in her nature.

116
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,462
I guess so.

117
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,256
You mean it’s in Reira’s nature
to have her way with guys?

118
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,215
Well, yeah.

119
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,551
But back then,
she was still in high school.

120
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,679
She was really cute,
and I also had my eyes on her,

121
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,763
only to have her snatched away by Yasu.

122
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,432
-That was tough to accept.
-Oh?

123
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,184
How long were you going out?

124
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,853
Let’s not talk about this anymore.
It was for a short while.

125
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,105
But it did last about a year, didn’t it?

126
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,483
-That long?
-No, about two years.

127
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,903
-That’s not a short while at all!
-Why did you break up?

128
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:12,658
I’m not good at defending myself.
Can we stop now?

129
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,664
Why am I feeling so gloomy now?

130
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:24,003
I was so thrilled when I heard Ren
was Nana’s ex-boyfriend.

131
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,423
But it’s a big shock to hear
about Yasu and Reira.

132
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,092
It may have been a long time ago,

133
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,679
but the fact he dated
such a pretty, talented girl.

134
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:38,518
Naturally, I’m not within his sights.
There’s no comparison.

135
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,686
We live in different worlds.

136
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,692
Suddenly, Yasu seems so distant.

137
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,653
But come to think of it,

138
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:52,865
everyone here lives
in a different world than me, a commoner.

139
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:58,162
They’re only being friendly with me
because I’m Nana’s roommate.

140
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,667
It’s your turn, Hachi.

141
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,960
What’s the matter? You’re spacing out.

142
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,336
Sorry!

143
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,714
Playing cards is boring, isn’t it?
It’s a game for kids.

144
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,216
You’re the one who said
you wanted to play?

145
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,342
Hachiko!

146
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,594
Beer. Didn’t we have more?

147
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,347
I put all the beer in the fridge.
Are we out already?

148
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,348
We’re out of wine too.

149
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,641
Did you drink that yourself?

150
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,892
Good grief.

151
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,603
Nobu, go buy some more.

152
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,939
Beer, wine, sake and shochu.

153
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,899
Why me? I haven’t been drinking.

154
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,651
Who do you suggest go then?

155
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,403
Get some cigarettes too, okay?

156
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,032
Shit. Maybe I’ll start drinking again.

157
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,617
Wait, Nobu. I’ll go too.

158
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,619
That’s gonna be too much
for one person to carry.

159
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:46,127
Yasu really surprised me.

160
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,130
You know, I was totally shocked.

161
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,466
Oh, right. You like Reira too, right?

162
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,135
She’s really pretty.

163
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,137
Huh? No, it’s not that.

164
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,389
I was shocked
because he was keeping it a secret.

165
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,226
Sure, Reira has a great voice,
and she’s very pretty,

166
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,894
but I’m not that big of a fan.

167
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,480
To me, she’s simply a celebrity.

168
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,648
Is she?

169
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,985
But once BLAST goes pro,
you’ll be a celebrity too, Nobu.

170
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,278
-You’re just waiting for your turn.
-Huh?

171
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,572
What do you mean "Huh"?

172
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,032
It’s been your dream to go pro, right?

173
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,617
Well that’s true, but…

174
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,162
being called a celebrity
just doesn’t ring a bell with me.

175
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,039
I’d love to be recognized
for my guitar skills

176
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,167
and eventually make a living with it, but…

177
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,504
I see. You’re in this because
you genuinely like to play the guitar.

178
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,382
It’s not as if you’re doing this
just to become famous.

179
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,009
That’s so cool.

180
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,137
A lot different from my perspective.
I’m so into the celebrity hype.

181
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,309
Well, but if I do end up becoming
famous as a result, I’ll welcome it.

182
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,226
I’ll welcome it too.

183
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,522
Moreover, as a BLAST member,

184
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,232
there’s this energy within me that says,

185
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,109
"Just watch me, I’m gonna make it big."

186
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,990
The fact that Nana and Ren
are back together

187
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:02,286
has added fuel to Nana’s feelings
to catch up with Ren.

188
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,498
And Shin began playing bass
because he admires Ren.

189
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,751
And me too. Ren has been
my role model for a long time.

190
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,380
And even Yasu.
He was so insistent not to go pro,

191
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,798
but now he’s teamed up with us.

192
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,428
Bottom line, we have to make it big.

193
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,430
We’ll defeat Trapnest.

194
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:31,357
But you know, the fact that
Reira and Yasu used to be a couple

195
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,317
gives you an added sense that
this is a fateful battle

196
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,069
between Trapnest and BLAST.

197
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,114
A fateful battle? You may be right.

198
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,409
But we haven’t even entered the ring yet.

199
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,870
I wonder why they broke up.

200
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,622
This is only speculation,

201
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:50,209
but perhaps it’s because Reira left
for Tokyo

202
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,378
with the other Trapnest members to go pro.

203
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,924
Back then, Yasu was studying hard
locally to become a lawyer

204
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,718
and only saw the band as a hobby.

205
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,387
So those two had different objectives.

206
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,472
Maybe they had their own ideas
about the future.

207
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:07,977
But you know,

208
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,856
if your speculation about the reason
Yasu and Reira broke up is correct,

209
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,942
then they could very well
get back together if they met,

210
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,861
like Nana and Ren.

211
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,530
No, I’m not sure about that.

212
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,241
I think what happened
between Nana and Ren is unique.

213
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,784
Unique?

214
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,245
Unique as in special.

215
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:31,917
Still loving one another after not
hearing from each other for two years

216
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,210
is not something most couples can do.

217
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,923
It’s only natural for people’s feelings
to change as time goes by.

218
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,925
Besides, I think finding
that someone who you can

219
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,220
feel so strongly connected to
is rare enough.

220
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,972
So you’re saying Nana’s met her soulmate?

221
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,516
-Oh, I love such stories.
-I knew it.

222
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,728
I actually believe in that kind of stuff,
being a romantic guy and all.

223
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,480
You’re a romantic guy, Nobu?

224
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,231
Is that something to laugh about?

225
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,193
I hope I can also have
such an encounter someday…

226
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,195
with that kinda partner.

227
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,198
But I’d be satisfied
with a happiness closer to home.

228
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,158
-Like with Aki from the convenience store.
-Who’s that?

229
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,619
Could Aki from the convenience store
be the cashier just now?

230
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,413
No. She’s an imaginative character
whom I feel close to.

231
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,499
Like Miyo from the tobacco store.

232
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:17,796
So a virtual Aki and Miyo?
He’s the fantasy type, just like me.

233
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,717
This is the first time I’ve talked
about stuff like this alone with Nobu.

234
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,470
We think alike.
We might just get along well.

235
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,391
Oh, you shouldn’t, Nobu.
Didn’t you say you quit drinking?

236
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,101
Nothing good comes outta drinking, right?

237
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,729
But nothing good happens
even if I don’t drink.

238
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:37,191
My parents have disowned me,
I get sent out to buy the booze,

239
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,693
I’m weak at mahjong, and I’m short.

240
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,200
I’m not feeling so down anymore.

241
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,702
If I had a boyfriend like Nobu,

242
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,996
I’m sure every day would be so much fun.

243
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,001
But am I thinking about him
because Yasu is out of my reach?

244
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,922
What’s the deal with that?
I keep going after different men.

245
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,216
But it’s not like just anyone will do.

246
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,718
Like Jun-chan said,
my surroundings are too bountiful.

247
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,680
I’ll ask him.

248
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,224
Say, Nobu, don’t you have a girlfriend?

249
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,351
I don’t.

250
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,647
Presently recruiting
"within-reach characters".

251
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,149
I might apply.

252
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,651
SUPER WITHIN-REACH CHARACTER

253
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,612
What? Takumi went home?

254
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,865
Mm-hmm. He got a call on his cell.

255
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,575
He said it was urgent.
A woman issue, maybe?

256
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,368
Yeah, knowing him I’m sure
it’s a woman issue.

257
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,828
He has no morals.

258
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,329
You’re one to talk.

259
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,414
Come on!

260
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,834
Why didn’t you keep him here
until I returned? Nana, you idiot!

261
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,838
Give up on Takumi, Hachiko.
He seems to be quite the player.

262
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,464
I don’t care about that!

263
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,758
You don’t care if he’s like that.
Then go ahead, do as you please.

264
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,721
That’s not what I mean!
I wanted his autograph before he left!

265
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,389
So we’re talking at that level.

266
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,603
Don’t cry, Hachiko.
I’ll get you Takumi’s autograph.

267
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,521
Hachiko?

268
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,107
I’m starting to think the nickname
Hachi is actually really cute.

269
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,525
May I have your autograph?

270
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,735
I think she likes me.

271
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,944
Will just anyone do?

272
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:10,659
There were many ups and downs,
but overall, this day was special.

273
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,787
Now that Takumi’s gone,
Hachi’s back to her usual self.

274
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,997
She must’ve been nervous.

275
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,458
-I was too.
-Liar.

276
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,963
That day, the only thing
Takumi and I really talked about

277
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,299
was Jun-chan’s tomatoes.

278
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,802
Still, I had a full serving of happiness.

279
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:34,016
But why is it that there is no limit
to the desires of human beings?

280
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:43,567
Who could it be? What a pest.
Let me sleep a bit more.

281
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,242
Shin! Wh-- What are you doing in my bed?

282
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,161
It’s so comfortable.

283
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,371
Did you do something?

284
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,374
No way. Because you won’t give me money.

285
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,463
Shin, that’s prostitution.

286
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,885
What should I do? He really is
sleeping with women for money.

287
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,221
I knew it but… how can I say it…

288
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,014
He is a young man of that certain age,

289
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,350
and he’s handsome, so naturally
he’d be popular among the women.

290
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,894
I thought it was just
the process of him growing up.

291
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,481
But for him to say he’s not interested
unless he gets paid for it?

292
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,651
Is it really okay not
to do anything about it?

293
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,238
Only Nobu is here.

294
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,865
What about Yasu? Has he gone home?

295
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,077
But it looks like someone tidied up.
Did Yasu clean up?

296
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,620
He’s such a great guy.

297
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,415
What about Nana and Ren?

298
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,292
DO NOT DISTURB!

299
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,754
The phone.

300
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,299
Oh, hello, Nana? Thank goodness.
I called a number of times,

301
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,759
but you wouldn’t answer,
so I was getting concerned.

302
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,636
You had so much to drink,

303
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,221
so I feared you wouldn’t be able
to get up on your own.

304
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,098
I’ve been calling you since this morning.

305
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,266
Were you able to get up okay?

306
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,019
Mm-hmm. Thanks. I just got up now.

307
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,271
Well, you do work for a publishing firm,

308
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,981
so I guess it’s not a big deal
if you start work in the afternoon.

309
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,656
It’s not okay!

310
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,915
Do you have hay fever?

311
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,168
Oh, you have a cold.
Are you feeling all right?

312
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,004
You didn’t have to come
if you’re not feeling well.

313
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,300
Or in fact, you don’t have
to come back anymore.

314
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,429
Ms. Sakagami!

315
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,931
The chief says I’m fired!

316
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,308
-Naturally.
-Huh?

317
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,436
No way. Ms. Sakagami.
Although you were hard on me,

318
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,522
I thought you were the kind of person
who would stand up for me in the end.

319
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,441
Do you think the world exists for you?

320
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,529
It’s a result of how spoiled
you’ve been acting. Farewell.

321
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:04,208
If I get thirsty, I can simply
buy a can of coffee for 120 yen.

322
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,463
However, I like having my coffee
in a cute café.

323
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,926
I wanna live in a fancy room,

324
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,930
wear clothes that are in style,
see the popular movies,

325
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:23,769
buy the latest cell phone,
get a driver’s license,

326
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,729
travel overseas.

327
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,818
So I need to find a job.
I need to work hard.

328
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,447
If I think I’m doing it for all that,
working can be fun.

329
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,951
But is it still not enough?

330
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,996
No matter how many things
I can think of that I want,

331
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,500
I can’t even find the strength
to get up from here.

332
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,336
Just one thing would do.

333
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,256
If only I had that something

334
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,258
that I could willingly devote
all of my energy to.

335
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,722
UNIDENTIFIED CALLER

336
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,226
-Yes?
-Nana?

337
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,728
It’s me, Takumi.

338
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,608
-Do you have a moment to talk?
-Sure.

339
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,402
Sorry about yesterday.

340
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:17,072
You went through all that preparation,
yet I left without thanking you.

341
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,617
I wanted to thank you properly,
so I got your number from Ren.

342
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:24,079
Thank you for coming. Sorry
I couldn’t prepare you something nicer.

343
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,123
You’re quite the chef.

344
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,333
The food was delicious. Thank you.

345
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:33,672
Are you still at work?
Sorry to bother you while you’re busy.

346
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:34,965
No, it’s okay.

347
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,134
I was wandering around
without anything to do anyway.

348
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,636
Wandering around? Where are you now?

349
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,554
In Omotesando.

350
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,014
Huh? Seriously?

351
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,725
I'm in Omotesando too.
I’m stuck in traffic.

352
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:45,642
No way.

353
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,852
Where about?

354
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:50,689
I’m driving towards Harajuku…
well I’m not moving at the moment.

355
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,567
Towards Harajuku?
That’s the opposite lane.

356
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,987
The traffic is at a standstill.
I’m stopped in front of Gucci.

357
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,071
Which kind of car?

358
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,448
A black Gelandewagen.

359
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,868
A gelen… what?
I don’t know it. What’s it like?

360
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,453
A Mercedes Benz, 4WD.

361
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,538
It’s a big car,
so it should be easy to spot.

362
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,583
I got it! There it is!

363
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,085
Come over.

364
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,131
That was the beginning of summer
when I was twenty.

365
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,927
Let’s take a side road and go somewhere.

366
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,136
Are you hungry?

367
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:26,099
The only way I could fill
the emptiness inside me

368
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:29,353
was to fall in love.

369
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:34,691
Hachiko is late. I guess we can eat first.

370
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,235
She may be doing us a favor.

371
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,071
Since you put that
"do not disturb" sign up.

372
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,907
That Hachiko really is a loyal dog
who knows what to do.

373
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,034
Unlike those two stray dogs there.

374
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,744
You got that right.

375
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,789
I wonder how long they plan on staying.

376
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,125
Back then, Nana,

377
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,754
everything about the world surrounding you

378
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,423
seemed so bright and shiny.

379
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,636
It’s not like just anyone will do.

380
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:07,599
I wanted to be bathed
in the same light as you.
