1
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:08,508
Although it’s already May,
the wind at night still feels very cold.

2
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:12,262
This is no different from my hometown
in the mountains.

3
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:18,143
I had thought that Tokyo
was a warmer place.

4
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:34,743
WRITTEN BY AI YAZAWA

5
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,014
Well, this may still be Tokyo,
but we’re way out in the suburbs.

6
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,143
Or rather, don’t you think
the weather’s gone nuts?

7
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,728
One day it’s hot like summer,
and then the next day, it gets cold enough

8
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,107
to convince you we’ve gone back to winter.

9
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,278
Is the weather gonna get even crazier?
I’m getting worried.

10
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,030
I’m a lot more worried about you,

11
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,574
Shin, the way you’re headed
on a direct path to destruction!

12
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,700
Why?

13
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,414
Oh, the phone.

14
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,751
Hello. Oh, Mayumi?

15
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,714
Mm-hmm, no problem. Where are you now?

16
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:58,386
Roppongi? I’m out
in the suburbs right now.

17
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,265
Then do you mind if I use a taxi? Really?

18
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,516
All right!

19
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,144
Yeah. I’ll be on my way now.

20
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,690
I’m sorry, but something came up,
so I’ll be going now.

21
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,692
Okay. Be careful.

22
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,110
-Although…
-Shin.

23
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,821
You’re free to choose whatever life
you wish to live,

24
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,866
but don’t you do anything that
will give the band a bad name!

25
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,200
Nana!

26
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,579
Shin’s only fifteen,
so you could be a little kinder

27
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,664
rather than push him away like that.

28
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,001
What would you do if he goes astray
and joins some biker gang?

29
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:38,468
Hey, Shin. I don’t know why you left home,

30
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,511
but I’m sure you were going
through something difficult

31
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,512
to make that decision, right?

32
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,809
Did your stepmother tease you?

33
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,603
-Stepmother?
-It’s all right!

34
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,022
You don’t have to tell me if it's painful.

35
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,650
But, Shin, please understand one thing.

36
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,820
If you underestimate women,
you’ll get hurt in the end.

37
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,325
Okay. I’ll be careful.

38
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,326
TAXI

39
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,123
-Oh boy.
-Not!

40
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,251
You haven’t fixed anything.

41
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,877
Besides, how is giving some advice
gonna help him?

42
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,797
Advice? You’re wrong.
I was giving him a warning.

43
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,340
I’m going home.

44
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,133
I have to start work
in the morning tomorrow.

45
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,134
Nana!

46
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,137
Don’t be so cold hearted and stay with me.

47
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,056
How do you expect me
to kill time alone here?

48
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,685
Are you serious about waiting here
until Shoji gets off work?

49
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,187
-It’ll probably be another hour, at least.
-But…

50
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,607
There’s no need to wait.
He said he’d drop by our place later.

51
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,986
But still! Jun-chan told me
I should show him that I care for him.

52
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,780
Whatever. Then let’s go
wait for him inside.

53
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:41,948
No!

54
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,658
Since he said not to wait for him,

55
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,994
openly waiting for him in full view
would only have the opposite effect.

56
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,121
Then like I said, let’s go home.

57
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,082
If he thinks I went home only to find that
I had been waiting for him,

58
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,501
don’t you think that would
touch his heart?

59
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,545
That’s just silly.

60
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,298
You have no clue how
a young girl in love feels, Nana!

61
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,549
I don’t understand!

62
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,802
I hate cunning women like that.

63
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,850
If you just say you’re waiting for Shoji
because you love him, then sure,

64
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,351
I have no problem staying here with you.

65
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,816
Well of course, that’s
the first and foremost reason…

66
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:21,904
Then all that other stuff is unnecessary.
Just wag your tail and wait.

67
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,875
I hate cunning women like that.

68
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:49,182
Nana! It’s okay! You’ll catch a cold.

69
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:53,019
I’m not that weak.
Besides, I don’t feel cold.

70
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,271
No way. It’s really cold today.

71
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,232
Compared to the cold weather
I experienced in my hometown,

72
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,026
Tokyo is like a tropical island.

73
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:03,571
The place I lived is covered
in snow half of the year.

74
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:08,117
So that’s what your hometown’s like.

75
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,999
I’d like to go there someday,
the place where you grew up.

76
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:21,005
-Thanks. It’s warm.
-Yeah.

77
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:28,012
You know how Shoji said he had
something he needed to talk to me about?

78
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:33,518
He had such a serious look.
It got me thinking.

79
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,312
So I’d probably be unsettled
and restless if we went home.

80
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,316
Sorry for having you stick around.

81
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,838
I couldn’t say anything else.

82
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:07,135
I just continued listening
to the tune Nana was quietly humming.

83
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,347
Nana’s eyes were so clear.

84
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,144
She seemed to fit in better
with snowy mountains

85
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,564
than in this city where
you can barely see the stars.

86
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,569
The truth is I am a very cunning woman.

87
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:29,198
I was no longer the pure woman
who would continue waiting for Shoji

88
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,284
while expecting nothing in return.

89
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,538
But I pretended to be

90
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,625
because I didn’t want Nana to dislike me.

91
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,004
Good night! I’m going on ahead!

92
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,402
Sachiko…

93
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,113
You know, I…

94
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,534
I’m gonna break up with her. Hey!

95
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,500
They’re finally finished.
Someone’s coming out.

96
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,043
Really?

97
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,878
Sachiko!

98
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,599
What?

99
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,987
This girl…

100
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,448
I’m sorry!

101
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:58,454
Sachiko? Of all the names…

102
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:04,502
What are you doing?
What’s with this woman?

103
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,604
-She’s my girlfriend.
-Huh?

104
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,484
Are you telling me that
you have two girlfriends?

105
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,821
You sure have it good!

106
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,407
This can’t be. This can’t be happening.

107
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,200
I need to talk to you about something.

108
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,203
There’s gotta be some sort of mistake.

109
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:41,747
I’m sorry!

110
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:47,128
There’s no way Shoji
would do something like this.

111
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,939
Don’t!

112
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,410
-Sachiko! It’s okay, stay back!
-Don’t be violent with Shoji!

113
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,746
Shut up! I won’t be satisfied
until I beat him up!

114
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,997
-Stop it!
-Stay out of this!

115
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,040
This has nothing to do with you!

116
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,042
You’re the one
who has nothing to do with this!

117
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,460
She’s right.

118
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,503
If you want to hit someone, then hit me!

119
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,214
-H-- Hey!
-I was the one who had a crush on him!

120
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,885
I knew he had a girlfriend
and still couldn't stop myself!

121
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,138
I won’t hide or run away,
so hit me to your heart’s content!

122
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,403
-You sure have guts.
-Cut it out.

123
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,156
Hachiko!

124
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,117
Why are you just standing there?
This is your fight!

125
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,869
Do something!

126
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,665
If you don’t fight,
you’ve accepted defeat!

127
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:09,585
He’s your man, isn’t he?
Fight to get him back!

128
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,593
I don’t want him.

129
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:29,980
I don’t even want to see his face.

130
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,753
I wasn't mature enough
to forgive his betrayal.

131
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:58,426
And I had too much pride to cling
onto someone who just hurt me.

132
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,303
I lose.

133
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,909
The next day, like a sick person,

134
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,621
I spent all day
not being able to get out of bed.

135
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,292
I tried not to think about anything.

136
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,129
I wanted to focus my mind
on something else to distract me,

137
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,256
but I didn’t feel like doing anything.

138
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,952
I repeatedly dreamt about Shoji.

139
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,053
Coming.

140
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,640
Who is it?

141
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,361
Ren?

142
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,366
What a surprise. It was a dream.

143
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,410
What is it with me,

144
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,830
dreaming of celebrities at times like this
when I’m supposed to be heartbroken?

145
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,374
But why Ren?

146
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,547
Could this have had something
to do with it?

147
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,717
But I'd rather dream of Takumi…

148
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,596
It really is the doorbell! Is it Takumi?

149
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,181
Or could it be Naoki? Maybe Reira?

150
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,143
Yes, coming!

151
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,859
Thank goodness! You’re alive!

152
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,905
Oh, it’s you. Hey, Jun-chan.

153
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,533
Come on! How many times
must I ring the doorbell?

154
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,785
You had me worried that
you slit your wrists or something.

155
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,329
Give me a break.

156
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,413
My wrists?

157
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:21,962
I see. So you heard about last night.
Slitting my wrists…

158
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,423
That may be better
than jumping off a bridge.

159
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,428
-Oh, Nana must've called you.
-Huh?

160
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:33,641
She’s working today, so she’s worried
about leaving me here alone all day.

161
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,936
No. Your roommate isn’t the type
to think of doing such a thing.

162
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,604
Huh?

163
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:42,274
Shoji called me a short while ago.

164
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,406
He’s worried about you.

165
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,243
The hell with him.

166
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,290
If he cannot come himself,
I don’t want him worrying about me!

167
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:13,013
You’re right.
Sorry, it was stupid of me to tell you.

168
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,685
But you know, Nana,
this is hard on Shoji too.

169
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,561
You know very well the type of guy he is.

170
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:23,732
-Are you taking his side, Jun-chan?
-No, this isn’t about taking sides.

171
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,693
He was cheating on me all along!

172
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,154
It wasn’t the whole time!
And don’t say that he cheated on you.

173
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,782
There you go again!
You are taking his side!

174
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,592
Maybe I am.

175
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:56,223
To me, Shoji is a good friend,
just as important as you, Nana.

176
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,308
I can’t always be taking your side
about everything.

177
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,228
Honestly, I have a problem

178
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,981
with your tendency
to be quick to play the victim.

179
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,316
It’s true. Shoji is at fault

180
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,820
for going after another woman
before clearing things with you first.

181
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,240
But before we focus on that,

182
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:16,118
you’ve gotta acknowledge
you’re also to blame for this, Nana.

183
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,499
I know that.

184
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:28,839
But I did the best I could, Jun-chan.

185
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:32,051
I even found a job,
so that I could make it on my own.

186
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:36,513
But that’s something you did
for your own sake.

187
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:40,309
From a while back, you would always
think only about yourself.

188
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,312
You showed very little care for Shoji.

189
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,776
Love is a relationship that
two people build for each other.

190
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:52,613
If you cannot care for your partner,
the relationship isn’t gonna work out.

191
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,427
I’m back.

192
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,479
You could at least turn on the light.
I know you’re depressed, but come on.

193
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:29,316
Nana! Welcome back. No way.
I didn’t realize how late it was.

194
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,651
You must be hungry.

195
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,487
I’m sorry.
I didn’t prepare dinner tonight.

196
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,949
I figured, so I bought us
dinner on the way home.

197
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,992
Let’s eat.

198
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,954
Are these tears of joy?

199
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,956
I’ve always thought this.

200
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,207
You always put yourself first,

201
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,792
but at the same time,
you’re so caring to others.

202
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,043
Caring?

203
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,169
And what’s this about me
putting myself first?

204
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,339
On the other hand, look at me!
I've only been thinking about myself!

205
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,259
It never occurred to me that you’d be
coming home on an empty stomach!

206
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,678
You don’t need to worry about that.

207
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,055
But a friendship is a relationship
two people build for each other.

208
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,473
Why are you suddenly
bringing up the obvious?

209
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,308
Let me at least make you some tea.

210
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,310
By the way,
there’s a letter for you from Natsuko.

211
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,814
Mom sent me a letter?

212
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,275
Bottom line, Natsuko has
a knack for sensing these things.

213
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,987
The way she contacts you without fail
when you’re in a bind.

214
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,280
It's because she is your mother.

215
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,408
NATSUKO KOMATSU

216
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:31,920
If she asks me to come home now,
I would be tempted to accept.

217
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:32,921
THIS REGISTERED LETTER CAME FOR YOU.

218
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,923
WOULD YOU AT LEAST GIVE THEM
NOTICE OF YOUR CHANGE OF ADDRESS?

219
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,970
Is that all?
Where are my words of consolation?

220
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,725
What’s the matter, Hachiko?
Are you all right?

221
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,768
This won’t do! Scissors.

222
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,021
Where did I put them? Never mind.
A paper-knife will do.

223
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,480
A paper-knife!

224
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,816
Don’t do it! Shoji’s not
the only man in the world!

225
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,111
I know that! But more importantly,
the tickets arrived!

226
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,822
-Huh?
-Tickets to the Trapnest concert.

227
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,911
I bought two tickets. Wanna go?

228
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:10,792
Nana…

229
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,213
no matter how unbearable life may seem,

230
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,006
good things will happen
as long as we’re alive.

231
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,098
They’re front row seats.

232
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,433
GATES OPEN 5:30 PM
PERFORMANCE 6:30 PM

233
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,935
RESERVED SEATING 5,250 YEN (TAX INCLUDED)
FLOOR 1, CENTRAL AISLE, ROW 1, SEAT 27

234
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,324
Now that I think back, during those days,

235
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:47,537
it was as if luck had eluded me
on a daily basis.

236
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,915
I never had much luck
with the lottery either.

237
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:02,678
Those tickets were something
God had set aside for Nana.
