3
00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:46.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re an only child, Nobu?

4
00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:49.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. My parents must be crying about now.

5
00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:50.652 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or rather, they must be really pissed off.

6
00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:54.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I see. I guess you were supposed
to take over your family inn, huh?

7
00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:58.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How big is it?

8
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.912 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A SPOILED CHILD

9
00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:03.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You only remember things like that, huh?

10
00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:05.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s going on in this head?

11
00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:09.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But when BLAST officially debuts,

12
00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:12.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll bet they’ll be so thrilled
they’ll forgive you right away.

13
00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:14.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you’ve gotta do your best.

14
00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:17.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah.
I’ll do my best for your sake too, Hachi.

15
00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:19.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told you, don’t call me Hachi.

16
00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But if I call you "Nana,"

17
00:02:20.723 --> 00:02:24.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can’t help but picture
the face of that cat-eyed queen.

18
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cat-eyed?

19
00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ve been calling her that
since the tenth grade,

20
00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:30.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so it’s become second nature now.

21
00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:32.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So BLAST has been around
since you were in the tenth grade?

22
00:02:33.444 --> 00:02:36.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, we started the band during the summer
when I was in eleventh grade,

23
00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:38.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but Nana and I were classmates
in high school.

24
00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

25
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:42.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, how was Nana in high school?

26
00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:46.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She never laughed, she didn’t talk much,
and she had this evil look in her eyes.

27
00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:48.626 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-She was totally isolated.
-No way.

28
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was so sure she was
really popular in school!

29
00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:51.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a shock.

30
00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:53.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, she was so gloomy.

31
00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She’s really pretty,

32
00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:57.510 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so even though she was quiet,
she did stand out in school.

33
00:02:57.594 --> 00:02:59.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you could never tell
what she was thinking,

34
00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:01.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so everyone was too scared
to get close to her.

35
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:05.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But when you think about it
in a normal sense,

36
00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:07.770 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it must've been lonely for her,
having no friends.

37
00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:13.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I tried blitzing her
with my non-stop talking,

38
00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but then she just ignored me,
which left me feeling lonely.

39
00:03:17.488 --> 00:03:19.991 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So then,
the music-crazed youngster Nobu figured,

40
00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:22.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"If I can’t communicate with her
through words, I’ll do it through music."

41
00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:26.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I made her borrow my CDs.
Ten of them, I think.

42
00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:28.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I tried to give her
different genres of music,

43
00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:30.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
thinking there was bound
to be one she’d like.

44
00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:35.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then she finally talked to me.

45
00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Terashima.

46
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks for these.

47
00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:45.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you get some more good ones,
can I borrow them?

48
00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:46.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>She smiled.</i>

49
00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:48.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ms. Osaki spoke?

50
00:03:48.102 --> 00:03:49.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-<i>So she can speak after all.</i>
-Wait, Osaki.

51
00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:54.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What’s your favorite genre?
Which one of those did you like?

52
00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:55.652 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What was it?

53
00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The noisiest one
with the kinda erotic name.

54
00:03:57.987 --> 00:04:00.406 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The Sex Pistols?
-Yeah, that one.

55
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My favorite’s punk, too!
We have the same taste!

56
00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:04.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How annoying.

57
00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:06.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was so happy.

58
00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.039 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was like
being liked back by your crush.

59
00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:10.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To me, that just sounds
like you were in love with her.

60
00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe a little.

61
00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:15.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You fool! I hate you!

62
00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:19.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But that happened in the past!

63
00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:22.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Besides, once we became friends,

64
00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:25.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I realized that I wasn’t seeing her
as a woman.

65
00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Otherwise, I would never have
introduced her to Ren, right?

66
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you were the one
who brought the two together?

67
00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:33.606 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

68
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nana had this dangerous, warped way
of thinking that no one could deal with.

69
00:04:37.568 --> 00:04:40.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought maybe Ren would be an exception
and could do something about it.

70
00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:45.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For the young Nobu,
Ren was an invincible hero.

71
00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:49.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was a big success, huh?

72
00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:52.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But not quite what I expected.
-What do you mean?

73
00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:55.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I realized little by little

74
00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that Ren wasn’t the strong person
I thought he was.

75
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Perhaps Ren was saved just
as much as Nana was in this encounter.

76
00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, when I was younger,

77
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:18.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
for no good reason, I thought that
guys had to protect their girls.

78
00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:20.778 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I always acted tough
in front of my girlfriend.

79
00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:22.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But that may have been a big mistake.

80
00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:24.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Why was that a mistake?

81
00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:29.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you want to be supported
by these frail arms?

82
00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.332 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. Totally.

83
00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:33.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s impossible.

84
00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:35.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ever since I fell in love
with you, Hachiko,

85
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I realized just how much
of a weak, shameless man I really am.

86
00:05:39.338 --> 00:05:40.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you mean?

87
00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:42.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Weren’t you gonna do anything
to make me happy?

88
00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:47.638 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sure I will. As long as you’re always
by my side supporting me.

89
00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:53.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>With you by my side,</i>
<i>I feel that I can do anything.</i>

90
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.396 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure.

91
00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:00.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Nobu loves to be pampered.</i>

92
00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:04.572 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>That’s a problem.</i>
<i>I’m the one who wants to be pampered.</i>

93
00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:10.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But what is this feeling?</i>
<i>It feels really sweet.</i>

94
00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:15.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I wanna be kind to him.</i>
<i>I wanna be by his side.</i>

95
00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I wanna be of help to him.</i>
<i>I wanna hug him.</i>

96
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I wanna be able to do</i>
<i>everything he desires.</i>

97
00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:28.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Until now, I’ve only thought</i>
<i>of being treated that way by men.</i>

98
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>That may have been a big mistake.</i>

99
00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:36.062 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good morning.

100
00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:41.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nana, you’re back here again.
What about Ren?

101
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s busy with work right now,
so he’s hardly ever home.

102
00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:46.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You left Misato all alone.

103
00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:48.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who were you with if it wasn’t Takumi?

104
00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:51.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wh-- Where’s Misato?

105
00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:52.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She’s still sleeping.

106
00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:54.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I’d better explain everything to her.</i>

107
00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:56.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But how am I gonna explain</i>
<i>so that she’d understand?</i>

108
00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:59.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>It happened immediately</i>
<i>after I broke it off with Takumi.</i>

109
00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:01.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>It actually overlapped a little.</i>

110
00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:04.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I’ll think about it thoroughly today.</i>

111
00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:08.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m working today,
so I’d better get changed and hurry off.

112
00:07:08.302 --> 00:07:09.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, by the way…

113
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Were you able to find
Nobu’s workplace yesterday?

114
00:07:12.723 --> 00:07:15.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, thanks. I had to see him
about something urgent.

115
00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:17.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You two really get along, don’t you?

116
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That guy’s always been
a genuine, honest sort of guy,

117
00:07:23.067 --> 00:07:25.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so you two share the same values.

118
00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:27.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, from the rest of the world,

119
00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:30.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you’re like two little dogs barking
for attention,

120
00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:32.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which is kind of annoying.

121
00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:35.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I’m sure Nana will understand me.</i>

122
00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:39.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She had to be lonely having no friends.

123
00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:40.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Because Nana for sure knows</i>

124
00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:44.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>a lot more great things</i>
<i>about Nobu than I do.</i>

125
00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:47.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Nana…
-Huh?

126
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, I… Nobu…

127
00:07:55.683 --> 00:07:59.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It seems like I’m head over heels
in love with Nobu.

128
00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:08.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn’t it natural?

129
00:08:10.114 --> 00:08:12.533 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Nana didn’t ask me any questions.</i>

130
00:08:13.242 --> 00:08:15.328 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>And if I said anything more,</i>

131
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:17.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>it would’ve sounded</i>
<i>like an excuse, so I didn’t.</i>

132
00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:22.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>There’s no need for me</i>
<i>to explain anything.</i>

133
00:08:22.793 --> 00:08:25.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I just need to treasure Nobu. That’s all.</i>

134
00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:28.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>And Nana will always be watching over us.</i>

135
00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:31.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, look, Kyosuke did this.

136
00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:35.556 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is incredibly well done.
That’s Mr. Kyosuke for you.

137
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s no need to add the "Mr."
He’s the same age as you, after all.

138
00:08:38.392 --> 00:08:41.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But he just seems older than me.

139
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mr. Kyosuke’s somewhat like
a father to you.

140
00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:46.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let’s leave it at older brother.

141
00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:49.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look, that one over in that section.
That’s Jun-chan’s painting.

142
00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:52.740 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's incredible! In many ways.

143
00:08:52.823 --> 00:08:54.825 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s impossible to comprehend, Jun-chan.

144
00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is it? Can you explain it to me?

145
00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:59.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m the one who needs an explanation.

146
00:09:01.123 --> 00:09:02.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Nana and Nobu?

147
00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:05.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. All lovey-dovey.
So much that it’s sickening.

148
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s that supposed to mean?

149
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:08.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I thought she preferred Yasu.

150
00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:10.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe he didn't pay any attention to her.

151
00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:14.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But she could've told us sooner.

152
00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why’d she hide it?

153
00:09:16.847 --> 00:09:19.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the guy she was hiding
from us was another guy.

154
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll bet he broke her heart.

155
00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:25.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In any case, she was really hurt
about what happened with her ex-boyfriend.

156
00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:29.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe Nobu was kind to her then,
and she went along with it.

157
00:09:29.318 --> 00:09:31.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. But it was like
she had completely forgotten

158
00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:34.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
about her ex-boyfriend
a little while back.

159
00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:36.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s true. I guess it just shows

160
00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:39.328 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that Nana’s ex wasn’t
all that important to her after all.

161
00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:40.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you’re saying that

162
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
there are a lot of guys out there
who are better than her ex.

163
00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:45.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, Mr. Ex-Boyfriend,
here’s your Jackson Burger.

164
00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:47.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cut it out with all the "ex-boyfriend"!

165
00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:50.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh my, I didn’t notice you there, Shoji.
I’m sorry.

166
00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:51.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re the one who invited me to come!

167
00:09:51.507 --> 00:09:53.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But we always find you here
whether we call you or not.

168
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even though you live farther away
since you moved.

169
00:09:56.512 --> 00:09:58.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? When did that happen?

170
00:09:58.139 --> 00:09:58.973 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Didn’t you tell me that

171
00:09:59.056 --> 00:10:00.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it wasn’t gonna happen
because you didn’t have money?

172
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:05.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shoji left his apartment
and moved to Sachiko’s place.

173
00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He made us help him move
although we were really busy.

174
00:10:07.481 --> 00:10:08.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So inconsiderate.

175
00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:10.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, I never asked you to,

176
00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:12.069 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you barged in
because you were curious.

177
00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:14.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sachiko lives one train stop away
from you, right?

178
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:15.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

179
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll continue coming here from now on too,
so don’t worry, Koichi Sato.

180
00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:20.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You don’t have to come.
-What?

181
00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:25.207 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nana no longer comes here
because you continue to hang out here.

182
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry.

183
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.171 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tell Nana now that she has a boyfriend
that she’s all lovey-dovey with,

184
00:10:30.254 --> 00:10:33.591 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
she can come here again
without thinking about her ex.

185
00:10:33.674 --> 00:10:34.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do wanna see her new boyfriend.

186
00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:37.136 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobu hasn't been here before?

187
00:10:37.219 --> 00:10:38.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I believe he lives close by.

188
00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:39.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
With his band and work,

189
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:42.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I doubt he has the time
to sit back and enjoy a drink.

190
00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:43.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That guru hasn’t been here either,
has she?

191
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:44.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Guru?

192
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Nana’s roommate.
-Oh…

193
00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:48.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is her boyfriend good looking?

194
00:10:48.397 --> 00:10:51.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Average, I’d say.
But give him a guitar, and he changes.

195
00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:53.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He becomes this super cool dude.
He’s a mysterious guy.

196
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:54.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess so.

197
00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:57.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s normally this helpless guy,
much like her ex-boyfriend.

198
00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:58.741 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now that you mention it,

199
00:10:58.824 --> 00:11:00.701 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
don’t you think that Nobu
and the ex-boyfriend are kinda similar?

200
00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:02.578 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh yeah, like the way they’re idiots
when they speak.

201
00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:06.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You think so? I think
her new boyfriend is conceited.

202
00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:09.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have you met him?
-No, I haven’t.

203
00:11:09.418 --> 00:11:11.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is according to what
Nana told me about him.

204
00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:14.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Apparently, he’s the heir
to a Japanese inn,

205
00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:17.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but he threw that all away to pursue
his dream and came to Tokyo.

206
00:11:17.134 --> 00:11:19.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That alone would be enough
to have Nana fall for him.

207
00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:23.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He said something like this
to the guru in a serious tone.

208
00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:26.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"I’m happy as long
as I can play the guitar…

209
00:11:26.977 --> 00:11:28.104 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and have you sing to it."

210
00:11:29.688 --> 00:11:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not something you can just blurt out
in a straight face.

211
00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:33.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s why you wouldn’t do it.

212
00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:34.193 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s so cold!

213
00:11:34.276 --> 00:11:35.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're no good

214
00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because you can't heat things up.

215
00:11:37.613 --> 00:11:39.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re rather the type who acts cold

216
00:11:39.281 --> 00:11:40.533 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
in order to hide your shyness.

217
00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:42.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
However, I understand now.

218
00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:46.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I fully understand why Nana fell for Nobu.

219
00:11:46.497 --> 00:11:48.707 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That man surely knows how to please her.

220
00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:51.961 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’ll normally be this good friend
who she can talk to about anything,

221
00:11:52.044 --> 00:11:54.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but when the time’s right,
he’ll say what a woman wants to hear.

222
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s the ideal type as far
as Nana’s concerned.

223
00:11:56.924 --> 00:11:59.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess there's more to it than just
Nana going along with the flow.

224
00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This may turn out well.

225
00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:05.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you think, Shoji?

226
00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:07.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do I think? I’m glad.

227
00:12:07.518 --> 00:12:10.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wish for Nana’s happiness
with all my heart.

228
00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:11.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you lonely?

229
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Koichi Sato! One more Jackson Burger.

230
00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m taking one to Sachiko.

231
00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:18.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Welcome home, Shoji.
-A present for you.

232
00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:20.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You were at Jackson’s again? Thanks.

233
00:12:20.781 --> 00:12:22.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m sorry that it’s not
a Louis Vuitton bag.

234
00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:24.410 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m hopeless, aren’t I?

235
00:12:25.369 --> 00:12:28.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Actually, I prefer the Jackson Burger.

236
00:12:32.626 --> 00:12:34.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder if we were too mean.

237
00:12:34.503 --> 00:12:37.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t think so.
We needed to put him in his place.

238
00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:38.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We sure did that, didn’t we?

239
00:12:38.215 --> 00:12:40.384 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In his position,
Shoji’s not about to blurt out

240
00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:42.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that he’s lonely under any circumstance,

241
00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:44.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but he’s gotta be feeling lonely.

242
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Men can be so selfish.

243
00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:50.102 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although it would be annoying
if he didn't feel lonely at all.

244
00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:53.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shoji did love Nana, after all.

245
00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:56.942 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He just loved Sachiko more.

246
00:12:57.026 --> 00:12:58.694 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you know,

247
00:12:58.777 --> 00:13:02.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
don’t you feel that’s because
Sachiko loved Shoji more than Nana?

248
00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:03.532 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think so?

249
00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:06.911 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But didn’t Nana love Shoji enough
that she couldn’t live without him?

250
00:13:06.994 --> 00:13:07.953 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

251
00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:09.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course, there’s no way
of comparing the weight of love

252
00:13:09.663 --> 00:13:11.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana and Sachiko had for Shoji.

253
00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just, Shoji probably felt more love
from Sachiko.

254
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe it’s a matter of how
they expressed their feelings.

255
00:13:16.587 --> 00:13:18.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana’s is very one-sided,

256
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so it’s difficult to grasp exactly
what she feels.

257
00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:23.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. Come to think of it,
while Shoji went out with Nana,

258
00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:26.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he would often come to our place
to get drunk and complain about her.

259
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:30.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>"Nana doesn’t love me for who I am.</i>
<i>She only loves the me that loves her."</i>

260
00:13:31.727 --> 00:13:34.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"You’re right!" I thought,
and I sympathized with him.

261
00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:37.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, although that likely
wasn’t Nana’s intention,

262
00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:40.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that’s how it looked like to others.

263
00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:41.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So when she found out that
he was cheating on her

264
00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and was quick to discard him,
saying she no longer wanted him,

265
00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:45.991 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that must’ve been a big blow to Shoji.

266
00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:48.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was the type of shock
where he’s thinking,

267
00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:49.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"So that was the truth all along."

268
00:13:49.828 --> 00:13:53.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Nana’s actions were more
because she doesn’t take pain well,

269
00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:56.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and so when she gets hurt,
the first thing she does is try to escape.

270
00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:57.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you're right.

271
00:13:57.836 --> 00:14:00.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She’ll quickly run away
and quickly put a lid on it.

272
00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:02.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She tries not to face her partner.

273
00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:04.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's always that thing about her
that makes her seem like

274
00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
she's having a conversation with herself,
even when she's talking to someone else.

275
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:12.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But lately, she no longer comes crying
to you like she used to.

276
00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:15.062 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe she is able to face her partner now.

277
00:14:15.145 --> 00:14:17.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let’s hope that’s the case.

278
00:14:17.147 --> 00:14:18.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So if and when Nobu cheats on her,

279
00:14:18.941 --> 00:14:21.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I sure hope she shows enough passion
to go crying to him and not let him go.

280
00:14:22.653 --> 00:14:24.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then if I cheat on you,

281
00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:26.532 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
will you come crying to me
and not let me go?

282
00:14:26.615 --> 00:14:28.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I’ll beat you to death.

283
00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:30.953 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I’m relieved, Junko.
-Why?

284
00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:31.871 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
THERE’S STILL HOPE FOR US

285
00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:34.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's all about how you
express your feelings, right?

286
00:14:35.207 --> 00:14:36.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
NANA

287
00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:41.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>This is the call center.</i>

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:48.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So she suddenly doesn’t accept calls
from unidentified numbers! Why?

290
00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:50.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

291
00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:53.642 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ren, the next page.

293
00:14:57.062 --> 00:14:58.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobu and Hachiko are together!

294
00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.441 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Then she’s going out with two guys?

295
00:15:00.524 --> 00:15:01.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Way to go, Hachiko.

296
00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:02.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you saying?

297
00:15:02.776 --> 00:15:04.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s no way Hachiko could manage
two guys at once.

298
00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:06.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She broke up with Takumi, right?

299
00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:10.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really? Well, she has good reason
to dump that guy.

300
00:15:10.284 --> 00:15:12.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-The same with you!

301
00:15:13.495 --> 00:15:14.914 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just call her without hiding your number.

302
00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:16.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's even less of a chance
she'll pick up if she knows it’s me.

303
00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:19.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, right.
-Hachiko? I thought you two broke up.

304
00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not really. She’s just pissed off at me.

305
00:15:23.964 --> 00:15:25.591 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
By the way, where the hell is the crew?

306
00:15:25.674 --> 00:15:27.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They’re late! What do they take us for?

307
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Takumi. We still have ten minutes.

308
00:15:29.845 --> 00:15:30.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’M STAYING OUT OF THIS

309
00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:38.938 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop reading erotic comics.

310
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:40.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just happened to be reading that scene!

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:42.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is Hachiko not enough to satisfy you?

312
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I am more than satisfied.

313
00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is she that good?

314
00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:49.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I talk to you,
I don’t feel like I’m talking to a woman.

315
00:15:49.406 --> 00:15:53.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I’m glad, Nobu.
You succeeded in making Hachiko yours.

316
00:15:53.243 --> 00:15:55.829 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I am very grateful to you.
-Huh?

317
00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:59.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know that you were rooting for me.

318
00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:02.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I got this really warm feeling
of friendship from you.

319
00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:05.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So annoying. It wasn’t for your sake.

320
00:16:06.006 --> 00:16:07.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course! It was for Hachi then!

321
00:16:08.425 --> 00:16:10.594 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You thought that, of all people,
I could make Hachiko happy, right?

322
00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:11.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I sure will make her happy!

323
00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.889 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s not like that.

324
00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:16.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hate to say this, but I just used you.

325
00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As a way to get revenge against Takumi?

326
00:16:19.603 --> 00:16:20.938 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It’s not that.
-Then what?

327
00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:26.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So that Hachiko can run freely
without a leash in my yard.

328
00:16:30.197 --> 00:16:31.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So keep an eye on her,

329
00:16:31.573 --> 00:16:34.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so that she doesn’t ever escape
to some other place.

330
00:16:36.203 --> 00:16:37.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobu!

331
00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:39.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana!

332
00:16:47.589 --> 00:16:51.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess a person’s true nature
will never change.

333
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
She’s still the same girl
with the same warped way of thinking.

334
00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:57.266 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I'd thought she became
softer because of Ren.

335
00:16:57.349 --> 00:17:00.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Nana’s desire to possess
is abnormally strong,

336
00:17:00.144 --> 00:17:02.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
even with regards to Ren.

337
00:17:02.563 --> 00:17:04.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, with that padlock and all.

338
00:17:04.773 --> 00:17:06.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Huh? But that’s because she’s
a fan of Sid Vicious.

339
00:17:06.734 --> 00:17:08.610 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s just a copy of that.
It’s nothing more.

340
00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:10.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think there is.

341
00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:14.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And she’s even got a tattoo
that’s a symbol of Ren’s name on her body.

342
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:15.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No matter how much she loves him,

343
00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:17.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
don’t you find that scary for her
to go that far?

344
00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:20.539 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then for Ren to gladly accept that

345
00:17:20.622 --> 00:17:23.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and continue wearing that
for two years after they broke up?

346
00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:26.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I find him quite eccentric as well.

347
00:17:26.962 --> 00:17:30.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Hachi talks of them
as the ideal couple.

348
00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:32.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Perhaps I’m the one who has
a warped way of thinking.

349
00:17:32.843 --> 00:17:34.553 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you’re saying Nana’s met her soulmate?

350
00:17:34.636 --> 00:17:36.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I love such stories.

351
00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:43.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Keiko? Oh boy. She can be a real sadist.

352
00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:45.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Real sadist?

353
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I won’t be coming back tonight.
Why not have Hachi come over again?

354
00:17:48.942 --> 00:17:52.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am really happy that you
and Hachi are together.

355
00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:55.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But weren’t you supporting us

356
00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:57.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because you wanted to keep her
in your yard as your pet?

357
00:17:57.493 --> 00:17:59.578 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You talked of me getting her back
as if she were a dog.

358
00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:03.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you’re wrong.
I just wanted you to show me the answer.

359
00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:05.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The answer?

360
00:18:05.459 --> 00:18:07.669 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"Men and women are
simply opposing creatures

361
00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:09.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
driven toward each other by lust.

362
00:18:09.171 --> 00:18:11.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Can they be connected by love?"

363
00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:13.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you two connected, didn’t you?

364
00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:15.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, you’re already having sex,

365
00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but that’s natural
between two people who love each other.

366
00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:20.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So love does tie you together, right?

367
00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:24.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Try it yourself if you wanna find out.

368
00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:29.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s impossible for me.

369
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We will first have them
sign a temporary contract,

370
00:18:33.654 --> 00:18:35.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and once details of their first CD release
have been determined,

371
00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:37.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we’ll switch to an official contract.

372
00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:43.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I will do my best to make sure we switch
to the official contract right away,

373
00:18:43.163 --> 00:18:44.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it doesn’t always go as I wish…

374
00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:46.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never mind the details.

375
00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:48.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anyway, I just need to put
my signature and seal

376
00:18:49.002 --> 00:18:50.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
on this temporary contract, right?

377
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, well…

378
00:18:54.716 --> 00:18:56.510 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I entrust him to you.

379
00:18:56.593 --> 00:18:58.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Still, I’m a little worried
about the world of show business.

380
00:18:58.887 --> 00:19:00.973 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have children too,

381
00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:03.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I understand your worries
about your precious son…

382
00:19:03.767 --> 00:19:05.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, that’s not it.

383
00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:06.895 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
With show business,

384
00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:10.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the media tries to dig up everything
about a person’s private life, right?

385
00:19:10.107 --> 00:19:11.441 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t want anything happening

386
00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:13.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that’ll end up affecting
my elder son and me.

387
00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:22.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, we thought it best to keep
his real name and profile a secret

388
00:19:22.202 --> 00:19:25.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and try to say he's eighteen.

389
00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:26.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That would be--

390
00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:28.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can do anything you wish

391
00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:30.127 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
as long as you keep
his true identity a secret.

392
00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t want the world to know
about the embarrassment of my family.

393
00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:36.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Also, could you mail me
the official contract?

394
00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:40.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can’t be wasting time
on something like this.

395
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
OKAZAKI

396
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:44.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Now, if you’ll excuse me…
-Mr. Okazaki.

397
00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:48.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He may not be your flesh and blood,

398
00:19:48.395 --> 00:19:50.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you did raise that child
for fifteen years.

399
00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:52.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t you have any feelings
of love for that child?

400
00:19:54.568 --> 00:19:59.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unfortunately, I have never felt love
for Shinichi.

401

Ms. Hachiko, we’re almost out of paint.

00:20:17.925 --> 00:20:19.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Sure.

405
00:20:20.427 --> 00:20:22.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sorry for having you help
with this, Misato.

406
00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:25.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, this is a lot of fun.

407
00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:29.937 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Painting the walls white makes
the whole room brighter. This is great.
