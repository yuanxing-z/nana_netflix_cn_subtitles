00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:22.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

13
00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

14
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

17
00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:52.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes. My head is clear, perhaps
because I didn’t take any medication.

18
00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:57.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is that so? That’s good, since you have
to talk to a lot of people today.

19
00:02:57.802 --> 00:02:59.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

22
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

23
00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

31
00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:31.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just order something from room service.

32
00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:32.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

33
00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:59.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:05:03.594 --> 00:05:07.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

48
00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:13.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>It’s as simple as that.</i>

49
00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:18.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>The strawberry glasses weren’t</i>

50
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:26.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

52
00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:30.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>which made me feel uneasy.</i>

53
00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:38.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Actually, both glasses were broken.
-Huh?

54
00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:40.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Takumi told me.

55
00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:44.302 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He said, "Your woman is terribly brutal.
You’ve gotta discipline her."

56
00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:46.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Discipline me?

57
00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:49.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When Hachiko saw them broken,
she was so shocked she started crying.

58
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Takumi apparently had a tough time
trying to calm her down.

59
00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:58.024 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Given the situation, it’s normal to think
that you broke them out of anger.

60
00:05:58.107 --> 00:06:00.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In reality, it’s not likely that
both would break by accident.

61
00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:04.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s natural that Hachi would wanna
move out without saying anything.

62
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
All the more if those glasses
were precious to her.

63
00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It’s more than enough
to give her the message

64
00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:14.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that you’re ending your relationship.

65
00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What am I gonna do?
That wasn’t my intention at all.

66
00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:21.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Then what was your intention?
-I don’t know.

67
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You really don’t remember?

68
00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:25.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you don’t remember putting
your phone in the water.

69
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sorry. And after you went to the trouble
of getting that phone for me.

70
00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:31.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Something was wrong with me.
-It’s all right.

71
00:06:31.432 --> 00:06:35.311 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you need a cell phone,
we can buy another one.

72
00:06:35.394 --> 00:06:39.774 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I lost all the phone numbers
and email addresses I had.

73
00:06:39.857 --> 00:06:41.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I should’ve kept a list.

74
00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:47.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, the few friends you have
are mostly my friends too, so…

75
00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:48.533 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

76
00:06:49.158 --> 00:06:50.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s right.

77
00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:52.912 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

78
00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:57.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

79
00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:00.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I have to get going.

80
00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re practicing again

81
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ask the guys directly when you’re there.

82
00:07:04.715 --> 00:07:07.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I’ve gotta call her right away.

83
00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:11.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rather than calling her, go see her.

84
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hachi’s struggling with morning sickness,

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:15.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:13.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You should tell Takumi the truth

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:15.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:29.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:46.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

174
00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:58.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the reason people are keeping
my situation a secret from only you is,

175
00:13:58.295 --> 00:14:01.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of course partly because
they don’t wanna talk about me,

176
00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:05.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I think it’s also
because they don’t wanna open up

177
00:14:05.135 --> 00:14:07.054 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

178
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I also intended to keep it

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:14.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:16.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But then I thought that’s all
the more reason why

181
00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:18.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I should tell you everything.

182
00:14:18.732 --> 00:14:23.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m sure your mother went

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:27.741 --> 00:14:30.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:34.164 --> 00:14:35.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

187
00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:42.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
what made you feel that your mother
should never have given birth to you.

188
00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:47.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t ever want my own child

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:54.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if the child is not Takumi’s,
I’m sure that would be agonizing for him.

190
00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the child
would eventually think it strange

191
00:14:57.313 --> 00:15:00.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:05.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

a happy family if we try,

193
00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:07.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I’d rather have you investigate

won’t this go to waste?

no intention of letting them debut.

212
00:16:25.442 --> 00:16:27.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even if they were to debut,
they won’t sell.

00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:32.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:40.207 --> 00:16:41.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:46.797 --> 00:16:51.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A world where "honor student" bands

00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:05.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Don’t remain at home thinking only
about the baby in your tummy.

00:18:06.668 --> 00:18:08.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
