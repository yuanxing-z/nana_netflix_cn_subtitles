I’m surprised.

Do you mind if we get home late?

12
00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:22.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tomorrow’s Saturday.
You don’t have work tomorrow, do you?

13
00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:23.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

16
00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:31.442 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry. It’s just…

17
00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:34.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

19
00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.534 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

20
00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:41.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

21
00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:44.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because, well, I never imagined
in my wildest dreams

22
00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:47.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that I’d meet you in this manner.
I wasn’t prepared for this.

23
00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s my line.

24
00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:53.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it would be to see you again.

25
00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:55.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way. That’s impossible.

26
00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:59.929 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, really. Otherwise,
I wouldn’t have called you.

27
00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.932 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The truth is, I’m terrible
at keeping in touch with people.

28
00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:06.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

What a restless traffic light.

32
00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:34.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And so am I.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:17.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Mr.?

58
00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:15.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’ve always just called me Takumi.

59
00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:17.775 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well that’s true, but…
that’s not the point.

60
00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:19.193 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It may not be something
for me to point out,

61
00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:20.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but aren’t you concerned

62
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of the risks of being seen
entering a hotel with a girl?

63
00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At the least, perhaps you should
wear a complete disguise.

64
00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:27.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A complete disguise?

65
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if I wore a costume,
I’d stand out even more.

66
00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:34.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’d look good in one!

67
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is no time to be joking!

68
00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:37.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not to worry.

69
00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.298 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The entertainment reporters are
too busy to be following my every step.

70
00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:43.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our band keeps a lid
on our public appearances,

71
00:05:43.342 --> 00:05:45.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so people don’t recognize us enough
that we need to be overly cautious.

72
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you saying?
Trapnest is really famous.

73
00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess Reira is. She may need a costume.

74
00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:55.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’d say all four of you share
about the same level of fame.

75
00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:57.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think that because you’re a fan.

76
00:05:58.357 --> 00:06:00.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The general public may
also recognize Ren, but that’s it.

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:03.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Naoki and I are known
as the blonde guy and the long-haired guy.

78
00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:04.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

79
00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:06.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

88
00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:37.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

89
00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:39.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

90
00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:41.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

91
00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:42.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

92
00:06:43.444 --> 00:06:44.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

94
00:06:49.283 --> 00:06:52.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right now, I’m so happy I could just die.

95
00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:54.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

97
00:06:58.292 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

let’s get something to eat.

98
00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:03.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

100
00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:09.178 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

101
00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:12.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

102
00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:14.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

105
00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:22.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:25.007 --> 00:15:26.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

254
00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:30.262 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So he really did become one,
even with that look.

255
00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:31.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

257
00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:39.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

258
00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:41.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

260
00:15:44.109 --> 00:15:45.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:47.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:51.867 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

263
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:56.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:02.252 --> 00:16:03.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

313
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What could they have found about me
that they didn’t like?

314
00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:19.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wanna know why you got fired
from your job in the first place.

315
00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:22.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, because I started making
a habit of skipping work…

316
00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:24.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But at the interviews,
I told them in clear terms

317
00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:26.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that I will take work seriously this time.

318
00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:28.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then you told them that you got fired
because you skipped work?

319
00:18:28.732 --> 00:18:29.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re such a fool!

320
00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:34.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’ve gotta realize, if you take
just any job that you can get,

321
00:18:34.154 --> 00:18:36.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you’ll end up with the same result.

322
00:18:36.448 --> 00:18:38.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why not look for a job
that better suits you?

323
00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What would be a job that suits me?

324
00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:42.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, maybe not specifically
one that suits you.

325
00:18:42.663 --> 00:18:47.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Any job will do as long
as it’s a job you enjoy doing.

326
00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:49.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If the workplace deals
with things you like,

327
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:50.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you’d be more motivated, don’t you think?

328
00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:53.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When you were working for Mr. Mizukoshi,

329
00:18:53.882 --> 00:18:56.844 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you were surrounded by nice things,
and you wore those pretty clothes.

330
00:18:56.927 --> 00:18:58.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You seemed so alive at that job.

331
00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:01.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why not look for another job like that?

332
00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:04.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I see. That makes sense. She’s right.</i>

333
00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:07.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder how Mr. Mizukoshi is doing.

334
00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:09.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never mind Mr. Mizukoshi!

335
00:19:09.898 --> 00:19:11.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I sometimes think about him.

336
00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:14.611 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t mind telling you now,
but I kind of had a crush on him.

337
00:19:14.695 --> 00:19:17.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don’t have to tell me. I could tell.

338
00:19:17.739 --> 00:19:20.909 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But, you know, taking Mr. Mizukoshi
and Takumi into consideration,

339
00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you have a thing for long hair, don’t you?

340
00:19:22.202 --> 00:19:23.412 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way!

341
00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s with your overreacting?

342
00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:27.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because you’re saying strange things!

343
00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:31.128 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Strange? I prefer men with short hair…

344
00:19:31.211 --> 00:19:33.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have it wrong!
Mr. Asano had short hair!

345
00:19:33.714 --> 00:19:35.340 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Asano?
-And so did Shoji!

346
00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:42.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I think his hair is pretty long.

347
00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:46.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah? Well, I guess that wouldn’t be
considered short.

348
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Seeing that you’re comfortable
talking about him,

349
00:19:49.062 --> 00:19:50.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess you’re over him now.

350
00:19:52.399 --> 00:19:55.652 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It would be nice if you could find
a boyfriend soon, one with long hair.

351
00:19:56.403 --> 00:20:00.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

352
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:05.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

353
00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:07.998 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

354

355
00:20:13.337 --> 00:20:16.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shoji, are you moving?

356
00:20:18.842 --> 00:20:20.594 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? Shoji’s moving in with Sachiko?

357
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They’re such a lovey-dovey couple.

358
00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:28.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s nice. I envy them. It's young love.
