00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:45.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.395 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you doing?
These roses must’ve been expensive.

26
00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:34.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What’s with the stingy comments?
You’re Trapnest’s guitarist.

27
00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:36.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Flowers wither after a little time anyway,

28
00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:40.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I’m making good use of them
while they still have value.

29
00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:42.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not a story I prefer.

30
00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you won’t wither, Ren!

31
00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:52.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In any case, look at this gorgeous room.

32
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you each get a room to yourself?

33
00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:57.171 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is what they call
a "Suite Room," right?

34
00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:00.508 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nope. "Deluxe Room."

35
00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s deluxe, all right,
especially this bath.

36
00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:07.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s unnecessarily too big.
I don’t feel comfortable.

37
00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Being here like this is
like going back in time.

38
00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We used to soak in the bathtub
every day like this

39
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and talk about all kinds of stuff.

40
00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:23.531 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The bathroom in our room was small,
but it was comfortable, and I liked it.

41
00:05:24.198 --> 00:05:26.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Say, Ren, what are we gonna do
about that room?

42
00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:29.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nobody’s living there, so it’s a waste.
You should clear it out.

43
00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:33.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s okay. That was my starting point.

44
00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:36.711 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One day, I’ll buy it,
return in my old age,

45
00:05:36.794 --> 00:05:39.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and quietly live there together with you.

46
00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:42.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t make decisions for me
about when I get old.

47
00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:47.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I was a kid,
that building was used for storage.

48
00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:50.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would run away from that
shitty orphanage and go hide there.

49
00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:54.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I found a guitar and made it my own,
and I would play it there all night.

50
00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:58.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Regardless of whether you were born
with talent or not,

51
00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:01.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
anyone could play well
after that much practice.

52
00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:05.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the first time you told me that.

53
00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:08.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I never told anyone.

54
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wanted people to think I was gifted.

55
00:06:20.004 --> 00:06:23.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don’t have to wash me.
I took a bath just before I came here.

56
00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:28.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Old habits die hard.
But why are you so embarrassed?

57
00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:30.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m not embarrassed!

58
00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:31.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like I’ve said many times,

59
00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:33.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m no longer on the pill,
so we’re not gonna do it in the bath.

60
00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I know, I know.
-Do you, really?

61
00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:49.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ren…
-Hm?

62
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That thing you said earlier. Is it true?

63
00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which one?

64
00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:57.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right now, I’m not about
to give up my pride,

65
00:06:58.417 --> 00:07:01.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I can’t live with you like we used to.

66
00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:07.593 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it would be nice if we could maybe
meet like this from time to time.

67
00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:11.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hold each other and talk about each other.

68
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And one day when we’re much older,

69
00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:20.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when I no longer care
about pride and recognition,

70
00:07:20.314 --> 00:07:22.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
when I’ve grown tired of singing…

71
00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:26.571 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then can I return to that home too?

72
00:07:32.493 --> 00:07:35.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>That night, I had a dream.</i>

73
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I don’t remember what I dreamt,</i>

74
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.296 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>but in that dream, I was wrapped</i>
<i>in feelings of warmth and happiness.</i>

77
00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.104 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

79
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:04.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, Nana.

80
00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:06.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How’d it go with Ren?

81
00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can’t answer anything you ask…

82
00:08:10.948 --> 00:08:13.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? What? I don’t understand.

83
00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:17.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What I said was,

84
00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:19.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can’t answer anything
when I’m brushing my teeth!

85
00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really, you’re not too good
at figuring things out, Hachiko.

86
00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:26.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I shouldn’t expect much.
You’re a dog, after all.

87
00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:28.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

89
00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:32.178 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There’s more miso soup, so just ask.

90

101

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.545 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What would you like? Beef jerky?

104
00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Takumi’s autograph!

105
00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:07.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Consider it done.

106
00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:10.883 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will ask Ren for it.

107
00:09:12.843 --> 00:09:14.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right!

108
00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Does a simple autograph
please you that much?

109
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s not that! You and Ren are
back together, aren’t you?

110
00:09:20.017 --> 00:09:22.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
W-- Well, I wouldn’t exactly… ah…

111
00:09:23.312 --> 00:09:26.524 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what I’m asking,
since we don’t have a phone in our place…

112
00:09:26.607 --> 00:09:29.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I do plan to buy a cell phone soon.

113
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But in the meantime, should he need to,

114
00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:32.947 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was hoping Ren could call you
on your cell…

115
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you want me to take Ren’s call and
relay his messages to you, right, Nana?

116
00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:37.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s right.

117
00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:39.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll gladly do it.

118
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:44.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Here’s Ren’s e-mail address,
so could you send him your address?

119
00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:45.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s great news, Nana.

120
00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:48.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It’s not!
-Why not?

121
00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:52.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why does it have to end up like this?
This isn’t what I intended.

122
00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:55.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I went to wrap things up with him.

123
00:09:56.345 --> 00:09:58.889 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My intentions were
to put an end to it all.

124
00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:00.766 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why did I get carried away?

125
00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:03.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s so lame.

126
00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:07.982 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>She said that while blushing</i>
<i>and curling up.</i>

127
00:10:08.065 --> 00:10:10.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I had never seen her look so cute.</i>

128
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:17.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Geez… major adrenaline rush…</i>

129
00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:20.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I want happiness as soon as possible too.</i>

130
00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:21.912 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or rather, a boyfriend.

131
00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then we’ll organize a party.

132
00:10:23.914 --> 00:10:28.336 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not that way.
I want a love that’s meant to be.

133
00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:30.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, but now that you mention it,
a party might be good, too.

134
00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:32.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What the hell happened over there?

135
00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:35.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t ask me. I’m on a top secret mission.

136
00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:38.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Top secret? Finding a boyfriend?

137
00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:42.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But meeting someone at a party
could also be a love meant to be.

138
00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:43.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don’t have to do that.

139
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’ve got plenty of men blooming
right in your own garden.

140
00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:47.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-My garden?
-Good point.

141
00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:50.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Take the band members
of your roommate’s band, for instance.

142
00:10:50.232 --> 00:10:53.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They seem like great guys for a punk band.

143
00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:56.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Isn’t there anyone from
the band that you like?

144
00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:00.368 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No! For one thing, Yasu belongs to Nana!

145
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:01.911 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Yasu?

146
00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:03.829 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Those two are an item?

147
00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But actually they’re not.

148
00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:06.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now I’m confused.

149
00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, you see, Yasu’s really kind to Nana,

150
00:11:10.002 --> 00:11:11.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I thought there were an item.

151
00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:15.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right. But Yasu’s like that
to anyone, right?

152
00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:17.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like he’s reached a higher spirit,
like a monk.

153
00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:18.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He is bald after all.

154
00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:20.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>That’s right.</i>

155
00:11:21.055 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Yasu’s kind to Nobu</i>
<i>and Shin and to me too.</i>

156
00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:28.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>It’s true. Yasu’s like that with everyone.</i>

157
00:11:28.437 --> 00:11:30.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>He’s like an elder brother to me.</i>

158
00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:33.484 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>In addition,</i>
<i>since Nana doesn’t have a family,</i>

159
00:11:33.567 --> 00:11:36.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Yasu must be thinking of Nana</i>
<i>as a real younger sister.</i>

160
00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:40.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>He must be feeling the need</i>
<i>to treat her better than a sister.</i>

161
00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:43.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I see. It’s all becoming clearer.</i>

162
00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:45.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Yasu’s a great guy.</i>

163
00:11:45.162 --> 00:11:46.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Right?
-Huh?

164
00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:47.873 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Listen when someone’s talking to you!

165
00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:51.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was saying, I wasn't expecting
that among the band members

166
00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:53.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you'd bring up Yasu’s name.

167
00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:54.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh…

168
00:11:55.005 --> 00:11:57.883 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought you didn’t like guys like that,
with such a scary look.

169
00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:00.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm-hmm. But Yasu’s different.

170
00:12:00.302 --> 00:12:01.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Once you get used to the skinhead,

171
00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:02.972 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you accept it as a charming part
of his character.

172
00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:07.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Also, I basically prefer calm,
composed guys who are older than me.

173
00:12:08.018 --> 00:12:09.895 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know that, right, Jun-chan?

174
00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And on that note, Yasu’s very mature.

175
00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:13.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-In addition, he’s a lawyer.
-That’s not part of it.

176
00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:17.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Take away his looks and his job,
and he’s still a great guy inside.

177
00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:19.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? A great guy inside?

178
00:12:19.947 --> 00:12:21.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I never imagined that

179
00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:23.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’d hear those words come out
of your mouth.

180
00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:24.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Great. Are you going for it?

181
00:12:24.535 --> 00:12:26.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Going where?

182
00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:28.706 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wherever you need to.
Until you burn to ashes.

183
00:12:28.789 --> 00:12:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Junko, don’t lead her on.

184
00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:33.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We’re only talking about who
she’d prefer among those guys.

185
00:12:33.669 --> 00:12:35.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Th-- That’s right, Jun-chan!

186
00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:38.757 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She’s blushing. She’s blushing.

187
00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:40.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You seriously like him, by chance?

188
00:12:40.217 --> 00:12:44.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No way! I’ve never once thought
about Yasu and me getting together!

189
00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:50.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>That’s right.</i>

190
00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:52.396 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>Nothing can happen between Yasu and me.</i>

191
00:12:56.233 --> 00:12:58.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Nana. You’re here.

192
00:12:58.777 --> 00:13:00.905 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
THUMP!

193
00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:07.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
G-- Good evening.

194
00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:09.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Where is everyone? Not here yet?

195
00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:11.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nana’s here, but she went out
to buy cigarettes.

196
00:13:12.082 --> 00:13:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see.

197
00:13:13.083 --> 00:13:15.377 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>

198
00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:17.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>With Jun-chan bringing that subject up,</i>
<i>I can’t look at him the same way.</i>

199
00:13:18.005 --> 00:13:21.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>And it’s just us two here.</i>
<i>What are we gonna talk about?</i>

200
00:13:24.136 --> 00:13:27.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yasu. I brought this Trapnest pamphlet.
Wanna take a look?

201
00:13:27.556 --> 00:13:28.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, thanks.

202
00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you hear from either Nana or Ren?

203
00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:32.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Those two are safely back together.

204
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really? I’m happy about that.

205
00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:37.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm-hmm. I’m really happy about it.

206
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:39.985 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was a bit down lately,
but now I’m feeling really good.

207
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:43.531 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Huh? You were a bit down?

So it’s okay for your own man to smoke.

Don’t you know there is a law that
says it’s illegal for minors to smoke?

00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:56.778 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t think it makes any difference.
There are many vocalists who smoke.

349
00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:58.780 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What you should do instead
is take some singing lessons.
