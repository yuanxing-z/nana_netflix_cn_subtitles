00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, this may still be Tokyo,
but we’re way out in the suburbs.

6
00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:23.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or rather, don’t you think
the weather’s gone nuts?

7
00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:25.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One day it’s hot like summer,
and then the next day, it gets cold enough

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:29.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to convince you we’ve gone back to winter.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is the weather gonna get even crazier?
I’m getting worried.

10
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:36.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m a lot more worried about you,

11
00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:37.574 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shin, the way you’re headed
on a direct path to destruction!

12
00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:38.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

13
00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:44.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, the phone.

14
00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:48.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello. Oh, Mayumi?

15
00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm-hmm, no problem. Where are you now?

16
00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:58.386 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Roppongi? I’m out
in the suburbs right now.

17
00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:02.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then do you mind if I use a taxi? Really?

18
00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:03.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right!

19
00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:06.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. I’ll be on my way now.

20
00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:10.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m sorry, but something came up,
so I’ll be going now.

21
00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:12.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Be careful.

22
00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:14.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Although…
-Shin.

23
00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:16.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re free to choose whatever life
you wish to live,

24
00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:19.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but don’t you do anything that
will give the band a bad name!

25
00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana!

26
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shin’s only fifteen,
so you could be a little kinder

27
00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:26.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
rather than push him away like that.

28
00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:30.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What would you do if he goes astray
and joins some biker gang?

29
00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:38.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, Shin. I don’t know why you left home,

30
00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I’m sure you were going
through something difficult

31
00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:41.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to make that decision, right?

32
00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:46.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did your stepmother tease you?

33
00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Stepmother?
-It’s all right!

34
00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:51.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don’t have to tell me if it's painful.

35
00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:53.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But, Shin, please understand one thing.

36
00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:57.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you underestimate women,
you’ll get hurt in the end.

37
00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. I’ll be careful.

38
00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:03.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
TAXI

39
00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:09.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh boy.
-Not!

40
00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:11.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You haven’t fixed anything.

41
00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:12.877 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides, how is giving some advice
gonna help him?

42
00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Advice? You’re wrong.
I was giving him a warning.

43
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.340 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m going home.

44
00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:19.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to start work
in the morning tomorrow.

45
00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:20.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana!

46
00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:23.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t be so cold hearted and stay with me.

47
00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How do you expect me
to kill time alone here?

48
00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you serious about waiting here
until Shoji gets off work?

49
00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:31.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It’ll probably be another hour, at least.
-But…

50
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:34.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s no need to wait.
He said he’d drop by our place later.

51
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:37.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But still! Jun-chan told me
I should show him that I care for him.

52
00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.780 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Whatever. Then let’s go
wait for him inside.

53
00:04:40.863 --> 00:04:41.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No!

54
00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:43.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Since he said not to wait for him,

55
00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:45.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
openly waiting for him in full view
would only have the opposite effect.

56
00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:48.121 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then like I said, let’s go home.

57
00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:51.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If he thinks I went home only to find that
I had been waiting for him,

58
00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:53.501 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
don’t you think that would
touch his heart?

59
00:04:53.584 --> 00:04:55.545 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s just silly.

60
00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:58.298 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have no clue how
a young girl in love feels, Nana!

61
00:04:58.381 --> 00:04:59.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t understand!

62
00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:02.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hate cunning women like that.

63
00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:08.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you just say you’re waiting for Shoji
because you love him, then sure,

64
00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:10.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have no problem staying here with you.

65
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.816 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well of course, that’s
the first and foremost reason…

66
00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:21.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then all that other stuff is unnecessary.
Just wag your tail and wait.

67
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I hate cunning women like that.</i>

68
00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:49.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana! It’s okay! You’ll catch a cold.

69
00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:53.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m not that weak.
Besides, I don’t feel cold.

70
00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:55.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way. It’s really cold today.

71
00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Compared to the cold weather
I experienced in my hometown,

72
00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tokyo is like a tropical island.

73
00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:03.571 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The place I lived is covered
in snow half of the year.

74
00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:08.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>So that’s what your hometown’s like.</i>

75
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I’d like to go there someday,</i>
<i>the place where you grew up.</i>

76
00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:21.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thanks. It’s warm.
-Yeah.

77
00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:28.012 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know how Shoji said he had
something he needed to talk to me about?

78
00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:33.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He had such a serious look.
It got me thinking.

79
00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:36.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I’d probably be unsettled
and restless if we went home.

80
00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:40.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry for having you stick around.

81
00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:01.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I couldn’t say anything else.</i>

82
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:07.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I just continued listening</i>
<i>to the tune Nana was quietly humming.</i>

83
00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Nana’s eyes were so clear.</i>

84
00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:16.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>She seemed to fit in better</i>
<i>with snowy mountains</i>

85
00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:19.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

86
00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:24.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>The truth is I am a very cunning woman.</i>

87
00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:29.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I was no longer the pure woman</i>

88

89
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:39.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

91
00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.004 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good night! I’m going on ahead!

92
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sachiko…

93
00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:09.113 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, I…

94
00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:13.534 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m gonna break up with her. Hey!

95
00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They’re finally finished.
Someone’s coming out.

96
00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:22.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

97
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:23.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sachiko!

98
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What?</i>

99
00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:49.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:51.572 --> 00:08:52.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:04.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you doing?
What’s with this woman?

103
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:23.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

160

She’s working today, so she’s worried
about leaving me here alone all day.

161
00:15:33.724 --> 00:15:36.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. Your roommate isn’t the type

162
00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:38.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

163
00:15:38.687 --> 00:15:42.274 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shoji called me a short while ago.

164
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.406 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

165
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.243 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

166
00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:58.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I don’t want him worrying about me!

167
00:16:09.009 --> 00:16:13.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re right.
Sorry, it was stupid of me to tell you.

168
00:16:14.098 --> 00:16:17.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

this is hard on Shoji too.

169
00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:19.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-No, this isn’t about taking sides.

171
00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:25.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He was cheating on me all along!

172
00:16:25.776 --> 00:16:29.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It wasn’t the whole time!
And don’t say that he cheated on you.

173
00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:31.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There you go again!
You are taking his side!

174
00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:50.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe I am.

175
00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:56.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To me, Shoji is a good friend,
just as important as you, Nana.

176
00:16:56.306 --> 00:16:58.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can’t always be taking your side
about everything.

177
00:16:59.309 --> 00:17:01.228 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Honestly, I have a problem

178
00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:03.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with your tendency

179
00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:06.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s true. Shoji is at fault

180
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

before clearing things with you first.

181
00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But before we focus on that,

182
00:17:13.323 --> 00:17:16.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you’ve gotta acknowledge
you’re also to blame for this, Nana.

183
00:17:20.164 --> 00:17:22.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know that.

184
00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:28.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I did the best I could, Jun-chan.

185
00:17:28.922 --> 00:17:32.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I even found a job,
so that I could make it on my own.

186
00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:36.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But that’s something you did
for your own sake.

187
00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:40.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
From a while back, you would always
think only about yourself.

188
00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:43.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You showed very little care for Shoji.

189
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Love is a relationship that

191
00:18:13.717 --> 00:18:15.427 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

192
00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:25.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You could at least turn on the light.
I know you’re depressed, but come on.

193
00:18:25.562 --> 00:18:29.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nana! Welcome back. No way.
I didn’t realize how late it was.

194
00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:30.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:30.734 --> 00:18:33.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m sorry.
I didn’t prepare dinner tonight.

196
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I figured, so I bought us
dinner on the way home.

197
00:18:37.574 --> 00:18:38.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

198
00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:41.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

199
00:18:42.037 --> 00:18:43.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

200
00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:45.207 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:46.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but at the same time,
you’re so caring to others.

202
00:18:46.875 --> 00:18:48.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

203
00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:49.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

204
00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:52.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On the other hand, look at me!
I've only been thinking about myself!

205
00:18:52.422 --> 00:18:55.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It never occurred to me that you’d be

206
00:18:55.342 --> 00:18:57.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don’t need to worry about that.

207
00:18:57.761 --> 00:19:00.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
