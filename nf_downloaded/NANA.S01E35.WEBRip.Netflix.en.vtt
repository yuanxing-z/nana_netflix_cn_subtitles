Reira, I’m sorry, but I’ve gotta

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll come home as soon as I can.

20
00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:26.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I just heard back from Mr. Takeda!

36
00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:23.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She didn’t go back to the hotel either!

37
00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She left with her stuff, right?

38
00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:29.078 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you try calling her cell?

39
00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:31.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Several times, but she won’t answer.

40
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But why did she run away like that?

41
00:05:33.624 --> 00:05:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She was all excited earlier,
saying she’s gonna sell a million copies.

42
00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:40.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Does anyone have any clue
where else she might’ve gone?

43
00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:42.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was transferred here recently,

44
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:45.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so there’s still much I don’t know
about Reira’s private life.

45
00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe she went to her secret lover!

46
00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:50.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come to think of it,
does she have any close friends?

47
00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:52.477 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I haven’t a clue. Don’t ask me.

48
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Takumi, you and Reira have been
friends since you were kids, right?

49
00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:58.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So what?

50
00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:01.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing.

51
00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What should we do, Takumi?

52
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Should we proceed with recording anyway?

53
00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:09.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With all this commotion around us,
we can’t concentrate.

54
00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can’t do it.

55
00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:12.413 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess so.

56
00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:14.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry.

57
00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:21.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s okay, Mari.
Your job is to take care of Reira,

58
00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:25.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so just worry about Reira
and don't worry about anything else.

59
00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:26.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

60
00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:30.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you understand that,
then go find her and drag her back!

61
00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I’m sorry.</i>

62
00:06:40.691 --> 00:06:45.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t cry, Mari. That guy is scary.
I’m scared of him, too.

63
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Drinking on the job?

64
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s water!

65
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:07.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If work is that important to you,
don’t go saying something

66
00:07:08.052 --> 00:07:11.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that would upset our songstress
before the recording.

67
00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:14.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it’s to test her professionalism,
you’re being too much of an evil coach.

68
00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:16.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

69
00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:21.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t try to act stupid!
You know Reira’s in love with you.

70
00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:22.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t put it so simply!

71
00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:26.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Years of acting like I didn’t know
just went down the drain!

72
00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:30.741 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Acting like you don’t know
won’t solve the problem.

73
00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you get married,

74
00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.537 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Reira might not be able
to sing anymore, you know.

75
00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.832 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If me getting married means
she’s gonna stop singing,

76
00:07:37.915 --> 00:07:39.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then we have big problems.

77
00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:44.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have no feelings of love for her.
I can’t help it.

78
00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:50.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I guess so.

79
00:07:50.928 --> 00:07:52.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if Reira won’t sing,
Trapnest is finished.

80
00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:56.559 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know that! So what do you want me to do?

81
00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:01.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If the lord showed a little more love,
the princess might wanna sing.

82
00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:05.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you telling me to do it with Reira?

83
00:08:05.526 --> 00:08:09.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She’s like a little sister to me!
There’s no way I could do that!

84
00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:11.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you’re not a blood relative.

85
00:08:11.782 --> 00:08:13.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s not the point!

86
00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:17.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you’ve always been the type
to do whatever it takes

87
00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:20.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to achieve your objectives.

88
00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:23.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Compared to marrying an ordinary girl
who’s only after your money,

89
00:08:23.377 --> 00:08:27.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you’ll end up with a larger castle
with a marriage of convenience to Reira.

90
00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Castle?
-It suits you.

91
00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:33.262 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I never knew you were so ambitious.

92
00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’d never do such a thing.

93
00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:41.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m just suggesting a way of living
for someone as greedy and brutal as you.

94
00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:42.396 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s that supposed to mean?

95
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t try to act like a good person!

96
00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:46.734 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re the man who abandoned
your woman and friends!

97
00:08:46.817 --> 00:08:49.362 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You even sold your soul,
all for your own success!

98
00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:50.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Although I’m the one who bought it.

99
00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:52.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My soul?

100
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You were a punk rocker to the core.

101
00:08:55.701 --> 00:09:01.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were coolest when you could play
whatever you wanted in a small room.

102
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Although you still are… a pretty cool guy…

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:08.673 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
like some orthodox hero.

104
00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:12.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wanna hear Ren Honjo’s soul shout!

105
00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:24.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But don’t you think it’s funny?

106
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The bigger the castle gets,
the more confining it feels.

107
00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:32.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Before I knew it,
I had locked my cute little sister

108
00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:35.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
in the top of a high tower…

109
00:09:36.158 --> 00:09:37.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
even though I can’t love her.

110
00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:44.584 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>That’s the greatest sin of my life.</i>

111
00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:51.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But she only knows how to sing</i>
<i>and nothing else.</i>

112
00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:54.844 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>And I can’t turn back now.</i>

113
00:09:56.679 --> 00:10:02.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If only there were a prince
who’d climb up that tower to hold her.

114
00:10:16.073 --> 00:10:19.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Turn off your phone at least
during recording!

115
00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:22.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we’re not recording.

116
00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:25.207 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, but at least have it on silent.

117
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello, darling! No, that’s okay.

118
00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:34.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The Lord is in a foul mood,
so we’re not getting any work done.

119
00:10:35.259 --> 00:10:37.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He’s right beside me.

120
00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:39.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who is it?

121
00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:42.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The former prince. Though he’s bald.

122
00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:54.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Um, excuse me.
You’re Takumi from Trapnest, right?

123
00:10:55.863 --> 00:10:58.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m a huge fan of yours!
Can I shake your hand?

124
00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:02.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you so much!

125
00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:04.997 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Who’s that, Mommy?
Someone who sings songs?

126
00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:07.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Someone who plays instruments.

127
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wasn’t that great?

128
00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:30.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sorry for causing you trouble
during a busy time.

129
00:11:30.147 --> 00:11:34.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Reira will hate me again for doing this.

130
00:11:36.278 --> 00:11:39.573 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But for her to say
she’s worthless unless she sings?

131
00:11:40.449 --> 00:11:44.412 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn’t break up with her
so I could hear her say such things.

132
00:11:45.287 --> 00:11:47.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do something about it.

133
00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:51.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If that’s how you feel,
then you do something about it.

134
00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:54.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Being the hated one is my exclusive right.

135
00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:27.997 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yasu, you traitor!

136
00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:37.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That baldie!
-Reira, please calm down!

137
00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:40.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s all right! I won’t take you back!

138
00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:42.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The recording has been postponed!

139
00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:50.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Takumi asked that you be given time off
until you’re ready to sing again.

140
00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:53.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He went and talked
to the president himself.

141
00:12:53.647 --> 00:12:57.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We’ll have to rearrange the schedule,
but at the very least,

142
00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:58.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you'll be able to take off the entire week

143
00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:01.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that was set aside for recording.

144
00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:02.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn’t that great?

145
00:13:02.698 --> 00:13:07.328 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Takumi may say some harsh things,
but he certainly thinks about you, Reira.

146
00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:12.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You’re wrong, Mari.
-Huh?

147
00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:17.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Takumi has abandoned me.

148
00:13:19.423 --> 00:13:22.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He doesn’t need a singer
who runs away from her job!

149
00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:27.806 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you saying?
I’m sure that’s not true!

150
00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:28.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry, Mari.

151
00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:31.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll return to the studio right away,
so let everyone know.

152
00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:36.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you couldn’t possibly sing
in this condition.

153
00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:40.778 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please! Don’t take away my chance to sing!

154
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.248 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Singing is all I’ve got.</i>

155
00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:57.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This restaurant pisses me off.
Don’t play Trapnest songs.

156
00:13:58.045 --> 00:14:01.048 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Play some Enka!
You’re ruining our ramen noodles, old man!

157
00:14:01.131 --> 00:14:03.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry! We’ll eat quickly and leave.

158
00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:08.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s only natural that the radio
would play what’s popular.

159
00:14:08.305 --> 00:14:11.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides, it’s a song Ren wrote.
You should like it.

160
00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:14.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This isn’t Ren’s.

161
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But more importantly,
you need to see a doctor.

162
00:14:17.481 --> 00:14:18.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A doctor?

163
00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:22.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Memory loss isn’t normal at all.
I’ll come with you.

164
00:14:22.778 --> 00:14:24.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way!

165
00:14:24.321 --> 00:14:27.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, you’ve been rude lately,
telling me I’m strange.

166
00:14:27.408 --> 00:14:30.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you were saying that yourself, too.

167
00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:33.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You could have some kind of brain disease.

168
00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:34.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You should get it checked.

169
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m fine. Darn. I shouldn’t have told you.

170
00:14:40.045 --> 00:14:42.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Annoying, annoying, annoying!

171
00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks for the meal.

172
00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:48.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, I’ll listen to your whining
as I promised.

173
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s all right.

174
00:14:49.805 --> 00:14:52.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I tell you, you might just
rub salt in my wound.

175
00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:53.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wanna hear it!

176
00:14:53.934 --> 00:14:56.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How could things have come
to this in one day?

177
00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come to this?

178
00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:03.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t you know?
What the hell have you been doing?

179
00:15:03.944 --> 00:15:04.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about you?

180
00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Where have you been hiding
since last night?

181
00:15:06.488 --> 00:15:09.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At such an important time for Hachi!
That’s so cold of you!

182
00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:12.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As a friend,

183
00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:14.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
shouldn’t you have gone straight to her
and heard what she had to say?

184
00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:18.959 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She would only cry and apologize to me.

185
00:15:19.043 --> 00:15:21.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She wouldn’t tell me anything.

186
00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:24.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you went.

187
00:15:24.506 --> 00:15:26.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You two are both women.

188
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She might’ve opened up and talked
to you about her true feelings.

189
00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:34.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But when I went back this morning,
Hachiko wouldn’t say a word to me either!

190
00:15:34.141 --> 00:15:35.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She had Takumi do all the talking.

191
00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:38.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What did he say?

192
00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:48.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s okay. Tell me.
Nothing will shock me anymore.

193
00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:53.911 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He said they’re getting married.

194
00:15:57.665 --> 00:16:00.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You <i>are</i> shocked! Of course you are!

195
00:16:00.376 --> 00:16:01.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It makes no sense, right?

196
00:16:07.007 --> 00:16:10.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry, Nobu. Are you all right?

197
00:16:10.427 --> 00:16:12.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, ah… yeah.

198
00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:16.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I sort of knew it was over
from the way Nana was acting yesterday.

199
00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:17.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

200
00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:21.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
After all, it’s Takumi she loves.

201
00:16:21.897 --> 00:16:25.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I knew that from the beginning.

202
00:16:26.735 --> 00:16:30.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

203
00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:36.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

so why am I out of the loop?

204

It’s okay to cry, Nobu!

206
00:16:54.138 --> 00:16:55.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

217
00:17:20.164 --> 00:17:22.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:36.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

230
00:18:36.156 --> 00:18:38.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

231
00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:42.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because they’re

00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:44.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:49.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

237
00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:54.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

238
00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:56.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:23.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
