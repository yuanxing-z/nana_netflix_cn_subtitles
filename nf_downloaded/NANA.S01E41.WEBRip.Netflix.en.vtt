00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:58.076 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, what do you wanna do
when we get there?

5
00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's try some real Italian food first.

6
00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:02.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I looked up some stores we can go to.

7
00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:03.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, isn’t he from Trapnest?

8
00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:04.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Huh? Whom?
-Ren?

9
00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:05.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, the long-haired one.

10
00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:06.709 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really? Where?

11
00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:08.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So where’s Ren?

12
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m sick of eating bread
for breakfast every day.

13
00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:15.176 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want some miso soup.

14
00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, I found
this great Japanese restaurant.

15
00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:22.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wanna go there tonight?
-I want some of Nana’s salty miso soup!

16
00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ren, keep your voice down.

17
00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:27.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ren, you’re better off forgetting
about women like that.

18
00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:28.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Women like that"?

19
00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
While we’re on the subject,
I’ll be blunt with you.

20
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:33.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I believe Nana is the type of girl
she’s rumored to be,

21
00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:36.531 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and you’re really being fooled by her.

22
00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:37.574 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If she loved you,

23
00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:38.867 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
she’d be more careful
about the salt content in her cooking--

24
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Take, let me go back to Japan earlier too.

25
00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:43.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s not fair only Takumi got to go.

26
00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:48.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, you still have your photoshoot.
Besides, he had his reasons.

27
00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:50.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? Takumi’s returning early?

28
00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He’s already left. Yesterday.

29
00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:55.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What’s with that?
Why didn’t he say anything about it?

30
00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:59.929 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He should’ve arrived in Japan by now.
-He’s so cold…

31
00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:04.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mom, I’m off to check in at the hotel.

32
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.228 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If Mr. Ichinose’s coming to see us
tomorrow anyway,

33
00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:09.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he should just stay over.

34
00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:13.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But he’ll be arriving pretty late,
so he didn’t wanna inconvenience anyone.

35
00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:17.947 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He shouldn’t be so formal.
He’s gonna be family.

36
00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They’re seeing each other
for the first time in two weeks.

37
00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.993 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course they want some time alone.

38
00:03:22.076 --> 00:03:23.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I guess you’re right.

39
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sure looking forward to tomorrow.

40
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:30.293 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Talking with him over the phone,
Takumi seems like a really nice person.

41
00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:31.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? When did you talk to him?

42
00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:36.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I answered the phone
when he called from overseas.

43
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Dad is so critical
when it comes to celebrities,

44
00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:40.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
saying they’re as bad as the yakuza,

45
00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:43.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but even he was praising Takumi
on his manners.

46
00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:46.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really? But Takumi is like a yakuza.

47
00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:47.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
HE’S GOT YOU FOOLED.

48
00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:48.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that so?

49
00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If he actually was one,
he’d take over the world.

50
00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:52.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He’s so cutthroat.

51
00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:55.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then God must’ve given him musical talent

52
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to keep him on the right path in life.

53
00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:04.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The world of entertainment
seems glamorous,

54
00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:06.412 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I’m sure it’s pretty difficult.

55
00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:10.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It will be your job to create a home
where he can relax.

56
00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:12.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So stop slacking off and do your best.

57
00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:14.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm-hmm.

58
00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:17.882 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By the way, how’s Nana doing?
Have you been keeping in touch?

59
00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:21.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. I heard that Nana's cell phone broke,

60
00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:25.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I haven’t been able
to call or email her.

61
00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:26.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And she hasn’t called me.

62
00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:30.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see. That’s a bit worrisome, isn’t it?

63
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. But from what my other friends
are telling me,

64
00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:35.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
she seems to be in extremely
high spirits and working hard.

65
00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:36.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Extremely?

66
00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:38.403 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s my Nana!

67
00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:40.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She’s a tough girl!

68
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.955 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I was so frantic to give Hachi the chance</i>
<i>to see me out there singing.</i>

69
00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:54.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

<i>Honestly speaking, I didn’t want to know.</i>

72
00:05:04.178 --> 00:05:08.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You haven’t touched your breakfast.
Are you feeling sick?

73
00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:09.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No…

74
00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Hey, Mari. I wonder
if Takumi met up with Stella.

75
00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? I-- I don’t know.

76
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But we’ve been so busy,
I doubt he had time to sleep around.

77
00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:24.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He raced through his schedule
for his fiancée after all.

78
00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:26.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That’s awful.
-Huh?

79
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:30.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, that might be okay for his fiancée,

80
00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:34.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but Stella has been Takumi’s lover
for a lot longer!

81
00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, is that so?

82
00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She might’ve even been secretly dreaming
of marrying Takumi someday.

83
00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:43.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I feel sorry for Stella.

84

86
00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:54.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You sure are amazing, Reira.
-Huh?

87
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.982 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To be able to see things from
so many different perspectives like that.

88
00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:01.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was only thinking of the feelings
of Takumi’s fiancée.

89
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.780 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Someone who can sing songs

90
00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that captivates the general public
sure is different.

91
00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:09.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

92
00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:10.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

93
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s just a matter of whose feelings
I can empathize with more.

94
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m a selfish person
who only thinks of herself.

95
00:06:19.837 --> 00:06:22.340 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have no idea how
Stella really feels at all.

00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:24.188 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Well, it’s not exactly common knowledge.

208
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.556 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m a law school graduate.

209
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:08.727 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s amazing! You’re not just wearing
those glasses for show.

210
00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:10.396 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, there’s nothing amazing about it.

211
00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:11.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And these glasses are just for show.

212
00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:14.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then what are you doing
being Reira’s babysitter?

213
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you mean, babysitter?

214
00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, like changing your diapers…

215
00:12:17.361 --> 00:12:18.863 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She doesn’t!

216
00:12:18.946 --> 00:12:21.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Enough about me.
-No.

217
00:12:23.617 --> 00:12:27.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wanna know more about you.
Are you free tonight?

218
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why do all our members try
to seduce every woman they see?

219
00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:31.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you Italian?

220
00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:36.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anyway, so that’s why
Yasu said he was a trainee.

221
00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:39.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I guess he’s in the midst
of his so-called apprenticeship.

222
00:12:39.216 --> 00:12:41.677 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it’s been a year and a half
since he graduated,

223
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so he could already be a lawyer!

224
00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:45.306 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, once you become an apprentice,

225
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:48.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you must go where you’ve been assigned.

226
00:12:48.225 --> 00:12:51.395 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He would’ve had no say
as to where he’d be assigned.

227
00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:54.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If he was devoted to the band,
it would’ve been difficult.

228
00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:59.069 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
His mentor probably
saw Mr. Takagi’s abilities

229
00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:02.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and hired him through the office
and had him do only deskwork.

230
00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:04.950 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mari, can you come here?
-Yes!

231
00:13:06.118 --> 00:13:09.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mr. Takagi probably couldn’t give up
his dreams for the band.

232
00:13:09.705 --> 00:13:11.081 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The fact that he hit that reporter

233
00:13:11.165 --> 00:13:13.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
shows just how much he cares
for his band members.

234
00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No matter what the public says,

235
00:13:15.169 --> 00:13:18.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Reira’s boyfriend
is a wonderful man.

236
00:13:18.088 --> 00:13:21.175 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t pay attention to the rumors,
and keep your spirits high.

237
00:13:21.258 --> 00:13:23.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mari?
-Yes!

238
00:13:24.261 --> 00:13:25.888 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Boyfriend?

239
00:13:25.971 --> 00:13:29.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What does that mean?
Wasn’t Yasu’s dream to be a lawyer?

240
00:13:34.605 --> 00:13:37.191 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s always been secrets and lies.

241
00:13:37.274 --> 00:13:40.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Since the old days,
I never knew what he was thinking.

242
00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:44.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have no intention of making
a living on music,

243
00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:46.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I don’t plan on
ever leaving this town.

244
00:13:46.408 --> 00:13:48.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I guess there’s nothing
we can do about it.

245
00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:53.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If the band is that important to him,

246
00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:57.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
was that just an excuse
to break up with me?

247
00:13:58.045 --> 00:14:02.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, he didn’t go that far
for the sake of the band.

248
00:14:03.634 --> 00:14:05.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This may be a problem.

249
00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:10.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I could no longer sacrifice
that much for Nana.

250
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:17.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wonder why.
I still love her like I always have.

251
00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:24.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, Ren. If I died,
would you die with me?

252
00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:31.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When did I become such a cold person?

253
00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:41.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>Reira. If you said that</i>
<i>you were lonely now,</i>

254
00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:45.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>I’d fly to London in a heartbeat.</i>
<i>I’d go anywhere.</i>

255
00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:50.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>If I could warm your heart and body</i>
<i>even a little,</i>

256
00:14:50.764 --> 00:14:52.474 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>then it would be worth it.</i>

257
00:14:53.267 --> 00:14:54.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>The way I say that,</i>

258
00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:58.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>you may get the wrong idea</i>
<i>and think I’m a kind person.</i>

259
00:14:59.023 --> 00:15:01.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>The truth is simply that</i>
<i>I don’t have anything right now</i>

260
00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:04.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>that is as important to me as you.</i>

261
00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>I don’t know about tomorrow, though…</i>

262
00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:11.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Sorry for being so selfish.</i>

263
00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:20.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s different
from being a cold person, Ren.

264
00:15:21.545 --> 00:15:25.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The longer we live,
the more weight we carry on our shoulders,

265
00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:29.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it gets harder to do what you want…

266
00:15:29.845 --> 00:15:34.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s why you need someone
to carry that load with you.

267
00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:40.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t you think you and your girlfriend
could do that for each other?

268
00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:57.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Welcome home!
You must be exhausted from work!

269
00:15:57.915 --> 00:15:59.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m really exhausted.

270
00:16:07.007 --> 00:16:07.883 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Souvenirs!

271
00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:10.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So many!

272
00:16:10.844 --> 00:16:12.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Which do you want?
-Just one out of seven?

273
00:16:14.932 --> 00:16:17.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How about this one!
-You’ve got a great nose.

274
00:16:17.851 --> 00:16:19.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You picked the diamond…
-Huh?

275
00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:21.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
…earrings. That’s a good choice.

276
00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:23.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No, I’d rather have this one!
-That’s some tea.

277
00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:26.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What about this?
-A pearl necklace.

278
00:16:26.193 --> 00:16:28.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wristwatch. Shoes.

279
00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:31.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A handbag. Cashmere scarf.

280
00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:33.701 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where’s the ring?

281
00:16:33.784 --> 00:16:37.454 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, that’s different from a souvenir.
You already have it.

282
00:16:37.538 --> 00:16:38.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where?

283
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your left pocket.

284
00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:56.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A magic trick?

285
00:16:56.098 --> 00:17:00.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s that tendency to let your guard down
that lets men trick you.

286
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:06.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I do have a list of priorities
that I cannot change.

287
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
First is work.

288
00:17:08.652 --> 00:17:11.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That makes up for more than
ninety percent of my brain.

289
00:17:12.072 --> 00:17:13.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everything else doesn’t matter as much.

290
00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:18.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I’d say my girl comes second.
I need her so I can relax.

291
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:23.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I won’t be able to care for you too much,
but I won’t let you have a hard life.

292
00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:25.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

293
00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:28.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As long as I’m your number one
second priority.

294
00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:32.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m sorry, but you’re number two
in my second priority.

295
00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:33.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

296
00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:36.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe this souvenir would best suit
my number one woman.

297
00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:37.306 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Shoes?</i>

298
00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:39.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They wouldn’t fit you anyway.

299
00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:40.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>She must be petite.</i>

300
00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:44.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sachiko…

301
00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:46.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it you again?

302
00:17:47.524 --> 00:17:51.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’ve already given her a name?
And what a traditional name.

303
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, whatever name’s fine with me.

304
00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:56.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Here! Then these are
for our little Sachiko.

305
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:05.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They’re so cute! Thank you, Daddy!

306
00:18:05.375 --> 00:18:07.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

307
00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:11.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But doesn’t that sound awkward?
Sachiko Ichinose.

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:12.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

309
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

310
00:18:14.802 --> 00:18:16.136 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Names using only
a single kanji character are best!
