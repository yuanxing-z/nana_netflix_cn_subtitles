00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:04.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way. Come on, give me a break.

Wow, this guy’s really strong.
Though his attitude sucks.

Shit. At least no one can beat me
in Shichi Narabe.

11
00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

we play Shichi Narabe.

It’s Naoki’s fault for bringing
a pack of cards along.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

18
00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:45.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

19
00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

20
00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:50.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

into Shichi Narabe at some point?

21
00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:52.881 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’d like to know too, Shin.

Teach me how to play Shichi Narabe.
I’m getting tired of Mahjong.

24
00:02:57.176 --> 00:03:00.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Shin, if you’re tired of Mahjong,
switch with me.

29
00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll switch with you. Where’s the toilet?

30
00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:15.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Over there.

31
00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:21.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:36.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:43.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

42
00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:02.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

43
00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:04.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

44
00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:10.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
J-- Jun-chan’s… ah, my friend’s family

45
00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

46
00:04:12.543 --> 00:04:14.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

47
00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:18.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would you like to take some with you?
There’s lots more.

48
00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.384 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

49
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.054 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

50
00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:25.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

52
00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

53
00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:32.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

58

-Hachiko, get the door.

59
00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll go.

60
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.761 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yasu, long time no see. How’ve you been?

61
00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:06.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Takumi, what are you doing here?

62
00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:10.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're classmates?

63
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, we went
to the same junior high school.

64
00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:18.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although we really weren’t that close.
I didn’t even wanna get close to him.

65
00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:21.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-I never knew that either.

66
00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’d always do stuff
that raised the question,

67
00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"As a human being,
should you be doing that?"

68
00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s amazing you never got sent
to juvenile prison.

69
00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:30.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Unlike you, I’m a delicate person.

70
00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:32.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Things were hard for me
during my childhood.

71
00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:37.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then we went to different high schools
and started our own bands.

72
00:05:37.378 --> 00:05:39.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We’d meet at band competitions,

73
00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it’s only after that
that we became friends.

74
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:44.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s a small town after all.
Not only at concerts,

75
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but we’d even bump into each other
at music studios.

76
00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:50.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Around that time, I used
to frequent live performances,

77
00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I’d say Trapnest left
the strongest impression!

78
00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was especially impressed
with the superb female singer!

79
00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:56.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just the singer?
-No!

80
00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.024 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The instrumentals too, of course.

81
00:05:58.107 --> 00:06:01.652 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Watch out, Nobu.
Takumi can become violent.

82
00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So Nobu’s a big fan of Reira.

83
00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:06.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, really?
Then should I ask Reira to come?

84
00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:07.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

85
00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:08.993 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll give her a call.

86
00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:11.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
N-- No, but I’ll get
really nervous around her.

87
00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides, she doesn’t know
how to play mahjong.

88
00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:14.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Don’t call her.</i>

89
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:17.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Who cares if she doesn’t play mahjong?
I’d love to meet Reira.

90
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Me too.

91
00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:22.340 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about you, Yasu? Can we invite Reira?

92
00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:26.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s fine with me,
but I wonder if she’d wanna come.

93
00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:29.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I won’t tell her that you’re here.

94
00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:30.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey!

95
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:33.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait a minute. What?
What was that all about?

96
00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:36.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Was there something going on
between you and Reira?

97
00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:39.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, nothing. Don’t worry about it.

98
00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You don’t know.
-I don’t. What is it?

99
00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:47.907 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She won’t pick up.
Tough luck, right, Yasu?

100
00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:00.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-These tomatoes are really delicious.
-Don’t change the subject!

101
00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:02.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What’s the big deal?
It’s all in the past now.

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:04.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yasu used to go out with Reira.

103
00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:09.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow! I don’t believe this!

104
00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:13.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yasu and Ren,
you’ve both been hiding so much!

105
00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:15.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Once again, I feel totally left out.

106
00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:18.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not intentionally. We just don’t talk
about everything that goes on.

107
00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You should!

108
00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:24.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I went out with her way back
when Ren and I were in our old band.

109
00:07:24.318 --> 00:07:26.529 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We broke up before I even met you guys.

110
00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:28.990 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There’s no reason for me to tell you.

111
00:07:29.073 --> 00:07:32.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You really had a tough time with Reira.

112
00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:33.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not something you’d wanna talk about.

113
00:07:33.744 --> 00:07:36.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What do you mean "a tough time"?
Stop adding to the truth.

114
00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:38.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But she always had her way with you.

115
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s just in her nature.

116
00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:42.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess so.

117
00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:45.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You mean it’s in Reira’s nature
to have her way with guys?

118
00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:46.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, yeah.

119
00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.551 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But back then,
she was still in high school.

120
00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:51.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She was really cute,
and I also had my eyes on her,

121
00:07:51.762 --> 00:07:52.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
only to have her snatched away by Yasu.

122
00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:54.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That was tough to accept.
-Oh?

123
00:07:54.515 --> 00:07:56.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How long were you going out?

124
00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:58.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let’s not talk about this anymore.
It was for a short while.

125
00:07:58.936 --> 00:08:01.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it did last about a year, didn’t it?

126
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:03.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That long?
-No, about two years.

127
00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:06.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That’s not a short while at all!
-Why did you break up?

128
00:08:07.945 --> 00:08:12.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m not good at defending myself.
Can we stop now?

129
00:08:15.536 --> 00:08:18.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Why am I feeling so gloomy now?</i>

130
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:24.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I was so thrilled when I heard Ren</i>
<i>was Nana’s ex-boyfriend.</i>

131
00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:27.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But it’s a big shock to hear</i>
<i>about Yasu and Reira.</i>

132
00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:30.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>It may have been a long time ago,</i>

133
00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:33.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>but the fact he dated</i>
<i>such a pretty, talented girl.</i>

134
00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:38.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Naturally, I’m not within his sights.</i>
<i>There’s no comparison.</i>

135
00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:40.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>We live in different worlds.</i>

136
00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:46.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Suddenly, Yasu seems so distant.</i>

137
00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:48.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>But come to think of it,</i>

138
00:08:48.736 --> 00:08:52.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>everyone here lives</i>
<i>in a different world than me, a commoner.</i>

139
00:08:53.574 --> 00:08:58.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>They’re only being friendly with me</i>
<i>because I’m Nana’s roommate.</i>

140
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s your turn, Hachi.

141
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:03.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s the matter? You’re spacing out.

142
00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:05.336 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry!

143
00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:08.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Playing cards is boring, isn’t it?
It’s a game for kids.

144
00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:10.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re the one who said
you wanted to play?

145
00:09:10.299 --> 00:09:11.342 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hachiko!

146
00:09:11.425 --> 00:09:13.594 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Beer. Didn’t we have more?

147
00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:16.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I put all the beer in the fridge.
Are we out already?

148
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We’re out of wine too.

149
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:18.641 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you drink that yourself?

150
00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:19.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good grief.

151
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobu, go buy some more.

152
00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:24.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Beer, wine, sake and shochu.

153
00:09:25.022 --> 00:09:26.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why me? I haven’t been drinking.

154
00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:28.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who do you suggest go then?

155
00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get some cigarettes too, okay?

156
00:09:32.446 --> 00:09:35.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shit. Maybe I’ll start drinking again.

157
00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:36.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait, Nobu. I’ll go too.

158
00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:38.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s gonna be too much
for one person to carry.

159
00:09:42.373 --> 00:09:46.127 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yasu really surprised me.

160
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, I was totally shocked.

161
00:09:49.213 --> 00:09:52.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, right. You like Reira too, right?

162
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She’s really pretty.

163
00:09:54.218 --> 00:09:56.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? No, it’s not that.

164
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was shocked
because he was keeping it a secret.

165
00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:02.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sure, Reira has a great voice,
and she’s very pretty,

166
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I’m not that big of a fan.

167
00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:06.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To me, she’s simply a celebrity.

168
00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:07.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is she?

169
00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:10.985 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But once BLAST goes pro,
you’ll be a celebrity too, Nobu.

170
00:10:11.068 --> 00:10:12.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You’re just waiting for your turn.
-Huh?

171
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:14.572 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you mean "Huh"?

172
00:10:14.655 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s been your dream to go pro, right?

173
00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:17.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well that’s true, but…

174
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
being called a celebrity
just doesn’t ring a bell with me.

175
00:10:21.245 --> 00:10:23.039 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’d love to be recognized
for my guitar skills

176
00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:26.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and eventually make a living with it, but…

177
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I see. You’re in this because
you genuinely like to play the guitar.

178
00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:33.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s not as if you’re doing this
just to become famous.

179
00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s so cool.

180
00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:38.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A lot different from my perspective.
I’m so into the celebrity hype.

181
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:43.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, but if I do end up becoming
famous as a result, I’ll welcome it.

182
00:10:43.392 --> 00:10:44.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll welcome it too.

183
00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:48.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Moreover, as a BLAST member,

184
00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:50.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
there’s this energy within me that says,

185
00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Just watch me, I’m gonna make it big."

186
00:10:55.237 --> 00:10:57.990 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The fact that Nana and Ren
are back together

187
00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:02.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
has added fuel to Nana’s feelings
to catch up with Ren.

188
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And Shin began playing bass
because he admires Ren.

189
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:08.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And me too. Ren has been
my role model for a long time.

190
00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:12.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And even Yasu.
He was so insistent not to go pro,

191
00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:13.798 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but now he’s teamed up with us.

192
00:11:17.426 --> 00:11:19.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bottom line, we have to make it big.

193
00:11:20.054 --> 00:11:21.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We’ll defeat Trapnest.

194
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:31.357 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you know, the fact that
Reira and Yasu used to be a couple

195
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
gives you an added sense that
this is a fateful battle

196
00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:35.069 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
between Trapnest and BLAST.

197
00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:38.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A fateful battle? You may be right.

198
00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:41.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we haven’t even entered the ring yet.

199
00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:44.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder why they broke up.

200
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:46.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is only speculation,

201
00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:50.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but perhaps it’s because Reira left
for Tokyo

202
00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:52.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with the other Trapnest members to go pro.

203
00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:56.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Back then, Yasu was studying hard
locally to become a lawyer

204
00:11:57.007 --> 00:11:59.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and only saw the band as a hobby.

205
00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:01.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So those two had different objectives.

206
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe they had their own ideas
about the future.

207
00:12:07.017 --> 00:12:07.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you know,

208
00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.856 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if your speculation about the reason
Yasu and Reira broke up is correct,

209
00:12:11.939 --> 00:12:14.942 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then they could very well
get back together if they met,

210
00:12:15.025 --> 00:12:16.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
like Nana and Ren.

211
00:12:16.944 --> 00:12:19.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I’m not sure about that.

212
00:12:19.613 --> 00:12:22.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think what happened
between Nana and Ren is unique.

213
00:12:22.324 --> 00:12:23.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Unique?

214
00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:26.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Unique as in special.

215
00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:31.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Still loving one another after not
hearing from each other for two years

216
00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:33.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is not something most couples can do.

217
00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:37.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s only natural for people’s feelings
to change as time goes by.

218
00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:39.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides, I think finding
that someone who you can

219
00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:43.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
feel so strongly connected to
is rare enough.

220
00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:44.972 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you’re saying Nana’s met her soulmate?

221
00:12:45.055 --> 00:12:47.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, I love such stories.
-I knew it.

222
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I actually believe in that kind of stuff,
being a romantic guy and all.

223
00:12:50.811 --> 00:12:52.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re a romantic guy, Nobu?

224
00:12:52.563 --> 00:12:54.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that something to laugh about?

225
00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:57.193 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hope I can also have
such an encounter someday…

226
00:12:57.276 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with that kinda partner.

227
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I’d be satisfied
with a happiness closer to home.

228
00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:04.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Like with Aki from the convenience store.
-Who’s that?

229
00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:06.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could Aki from the convenience store
be the cashier just now?

230
00:13:06.702 --> 00:13:09.413 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. She’s an imaginative character
whom I feel close to.

231
00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:11.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like Miyo from the tobacco store.

232
00:13:12.666 --> 00:13:17.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>So a virtual Aki and Miyo?</i>
<i>He’s the fantasy type, just like me.</i>

233
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>This is the first time I’ve talked</i>
<i>about stuff like this alone with Nobu.</i>

234
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>We think alike.</i>
<i>We might just get along well.</i>

235
00:13:26.263 --> 00:13:29.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, you shouldn’t, Nobu.
Didn’t you say you quit drinking?

236
00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:31.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing good comes outta drinking, right?

237
00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:33.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But nothing good happens
even if I don’t drink.

238
00:13:33.812 --> 00:13:37.191 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My parents have disowned me,
I get sent out to buy the booze,

239
00:13:37.274 --> 00:13:39.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m weak at mahjong, and I’m short.

240
00:13:44.406 --> 00:13:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

241
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:48.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>If I had a boyfriend like Nobu,</i>

242
00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:50.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I’m sure every day would be so much fun.</i>

243
00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:56.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But am I thinking about him</i>
<i>because Yasu is out of my reach?</i>

244
00:13:56.085 --> 00:13:59.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>What’s the deal with that?</i>
<i>I keep going after different men.</i>

245
00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:02.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>But it’s not like just anyone will do.</i>

246
00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:04.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Like Jun-chan said,</i>

247
00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:07.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I’ll ask him.</i>

248
00:14:07.763 --> 00:14:10.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Say, Nobu, don’t you have a girlfriend?

249
00:14:11.392 --> 00:14:12.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t.

250
00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:16.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Presently recruiting
"within-reach characters".

251
00:14:17.314 --> 00:14:19.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

252
00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:20.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
SUPER WITHIN-REACH CHARACTER

253
00:14:21.443 --> 00:14:23.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? Takumi went home?

254
00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:25.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm-hmm. He got a call on his cell.

255
00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:27.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He said it was urgent.
A woman issue, maybe?

256
00:14:27.658 --> 00:14:29.368 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, knowing him I’m sure
it’s a woman issue.

257
00:14:29.451 --> 00:14:30.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He has no morals.

258
00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:32.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re one to talk.

259
00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:33.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

260
00:14:33.497 --> 00:14:36.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why didn’t you keep him here
until I returned? Nana, you idiot!

261
00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:40.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Give up on Takumi, Hachiko.
He seems to be quite the player.

262
00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:42.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t care about that!

263
00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:44.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don’t care if he’s like that.
Then go ahead, do as you please.

264
00:14:44.842 --> 00:14:48.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s not what I mean!
I wanted his autograph before he left!

265
00:14:48.804 --> 00:14:50.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So we’re talking at that level.

266
00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t cry, Hachiko.
I’ll get you Takumi’s autograph.

267
00:14:55.686 --> 00:14:57.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

270
00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:02.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

271
00:15:02.818 --> 00:15:03.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

273
00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:13.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now that Takumi’s gone,
Hachi’s back to her usual self.

274
00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:14.997 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She must’ve been nervous.

275
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

279
00:15:29.553 --> 00:15:34.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:54.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

283
00:15:54.244 --> 00:15:55.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

284
00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:58.374 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way. Because you won’t give me money.

285

I called a number of times,

00:16:49.383 --> 00:16:50.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:03.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
