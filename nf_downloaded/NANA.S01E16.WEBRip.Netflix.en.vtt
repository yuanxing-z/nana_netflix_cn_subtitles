What is it, so early in the morning?

7
00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Same goes for you.
What’s up with that outfit?

8
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.731 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you going to work already?

9
00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:33.069 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I came back from work
and continued working.

10
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:36.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Work? But it was a public holiday.

11
00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:39.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Law firms can be really busy, huh?

12
00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:40.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

13
00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:43.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was gonna take a nap
before going back to work.

14
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m coming in.

15
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you doing here?

16
00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:59.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was hanging out with Misato
in her hotel room,

17
00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:03.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but a single bed just
isn’t big enough for two people.

18
00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:06.477 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That girl’s still here? What about school?

19
00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:07.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She says her school is full of floozies

20
00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and she has no real friends,
so she doesn’t wanna go.

21
00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.484 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But her parents must be worried.

22
00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:15.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That girl looks like the princess type
from a wealthy family after all.

23
00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:20.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, I hear they don’t really care.
It’s like what Shin was saying.

24
00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:21.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe she’ll end up
running away from home.

25
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shin… He’s becoming quite a handful.

26
00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:29.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just hope he doesn’t get in trouble.

27
00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s taken on
a different appearance lately.

28
00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:33.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Talk about appearance, Yasu.

29
00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:34.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ve been thinking for some time now…

30
00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:37.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you look scarier without your sunglasses.

31
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:40.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shut up.

32
00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Usually, it’s the other way around.

33
00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:46.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Either way, it’s not the look of a lawyer.

34
00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:51.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nana… If you’re gonna sleep,
go sleep at your own place.

35
00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:52.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wanna sleep with me?

36
00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:54.817 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you saying? Don’t mess with me.

37
00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.277 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I’m leaving.

38
00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:03.534 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait.

39
00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You wanted to talk to me
about something, didn’t you?

40
00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:07.163 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happened?

41
00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:10.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sorry for coming without a reason.
Good night.

42
00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:39.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana!

43
00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:51.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I return to work today,</i>
<i>so I’d better get some sleep.</i>

44
00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:55.336 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Or so I thought,</i>
<i>but I couldn’t get any sleep.</i>

45
00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana!

46
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry.

47
00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:07.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn’t mean to say the things I said.

48
00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:08.266 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just, some things happened,

49
00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I was irritated,
and I guess I took it out on you.

50
00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:12.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m really sorry.

51
00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:14.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you mad at me?

52
00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:17.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m not mad, really.

53
00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:20.945 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just like you said, I got carried away
and did as I wanted.

54
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then why didn’t you come home
until morning?

55
00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:26.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nana, you don’t carry a cell phone,
so I didn’t know what to do.

56
00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:28.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I kept thinking about it
and couldn’t get any sleep!

57
00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:30.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Am I your boyfriend or something?

58
00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:32.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re more important to me
than a boyfriend.

59
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
By the way, what happened to Misato?

60
00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:36.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did she go home?

61
00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. She’s at the hotel sleeping.

62
00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:41.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She said that she might go home
after she checks out at noon today.

63
00:05:41.215 --> 00:05:43.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is that so? What should I do?
-About what?

64
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:48.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She must think I’m such a bitch.
She didn’t do anything wrong.

65
00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:51.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She was having so much fun,
and I ruined it all.

66
00:05:51.392 --> 00:05:52.727 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want to apologize.

67
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Say, does she have a cell phone?

68
00:05:55.396 --> 00:05:56.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, she does.

69
00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give me her number. I’ll give her a call.

70
00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:01.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sure, but she’s likely still asleep,
so wait until after noon.

71
00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:03.905 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Mm-hmm!
-Hold on a moment.

72
00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:08.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have it written down somewhere.

73
00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:10.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, Nana. What time
can you make it home today?

74
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give me some space!

75
00:06:12.413 --> 00:06:13.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can we have dinner together?

76
00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s fine with me,
but it’ll be like nine o'clock tonight.

77
00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then I’ll cook something
to make it up to you.

78
00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

86

I was thinking about a new project.

you don’t have the experience

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:25.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:38.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:58.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:00.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’ve always respected Ren, right?

174
00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:02.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

175
00:11:03.287 --> 00:11:06.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why? Did you by chance become

176
00:11:06.957 --> 00:11:08.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

No. Nobu got drunk and told me.

179
00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:14.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

180
00:11:14.256 --> 00:11:15.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

181
00:11:15.883 --> 00:11:17.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

182
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right after I became a member of Blast.

183
00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:22.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shin, if you knew, why didn’t you
tell me anything about it?

184
00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:25.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because everyone avoids talking about Ren,

185
00:11:25.309 --> 00:11:27.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to the point that it’s obvious,

186
00:11:27.436 --> 00:11:29.980 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

pretending I never heard anything.

187
00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:31.816 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

189
00:11:33.984 --> 00:11:36.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it was me, I would never be able

190
00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:38.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I tend to get all worked up about it,

191
00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:41.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

192
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

193
00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:45.162 --> 00:11:46.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

197
00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:55.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll tell you everything I know.

198
00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:58.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because I might’ve told you lies,
since I was drunk, you know?

199
00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:01.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ren was Blast’s bassist.

200
00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:03.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He and Nana were lovers,

00:12:03.722 --> 00:12:05.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

202
00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:08.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he was offered the chance

203
00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:11.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He came to Tokyo alone,
and no one’s heard from him since.

204
00:12:11.522 --> 00:12:13.274 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

205
00:12:13.357 --> 00:12:16.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait! No one’s heard from him since?

206
00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:19.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They had a tearful breakup, right?

207
00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:22.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s right. And there’s nothing left
for me to tell you.

208
00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:26.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tearful?
But just because Ren came to Tokyo,

209
00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:27.997 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that doesn’t mean they had to break up.

210
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.709 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re right. You had
a long-distance relationship

211
00:12:31.792 --> 00:12:34.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with your boyfriend, Hachi,
and it has lasted.

212
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, yeah…

213
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, that came to an end
after I came here.

214
00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:41.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You broke up with your boyfriend?
-It came to an end?

215
00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:42.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re kidding!

216
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.847 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But we just went to his workplace
the other day.

217
00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:51.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, but… somehow, after that…
Never mind about me.

218
00:12:51.687 --> 00:12:56.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll bitch to you about the whole thing
over some drinks another time.

219
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. I’m done with alcohol.

220
00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:01.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is it something to bitch about?
Did he cheat on you?

221
00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bingo.

222
00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:06.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A-- Anyway, right now, we’re talking
about why Nana and Ren broke up.

223
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I suggest you talk to Nana directly
about their reasons for breaking up.

224
00:13:10.372 --> 00:13:12.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, that wouldn’t be good!

225
00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:13.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why’s that?

226
00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:16.545 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Listen, everyone’s got
a couple of painful memories

227
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they’d rather not share with anyone.

228
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it that painful of a memory?

229
00:13:20.257 --> 00:13:22.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But if they broke up in tears,

230
00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:24.929 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that would mean they were
doing great until then, right?

231
00:13:25.012 --> 00:13:28.766 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s right, but how can I say it…

232
00:13:28.849 --> 00:13:33.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t hate Ren,
and I don’t wanna badmouth him,

233
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but Ren decided to leave Blast
and join Trapnest

234
00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:39.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
without talking it over
with Nana or myself.

235
00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:41.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Only Yasu knew about it.

236
00:13:42.279 --> 00:13:46.909 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So at that time, I really felt betrayed,
and it came as a great shock.

237
00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:50.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As a fellow musician, my pride took a hit,

238
00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:51.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I felt frustrated.

239
00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:56.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But both Nana and I
acknowledged Ren’s talents,

240
00:13:56.085 --> 00:13:57.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and we respected that.

241
00:13:57.878 --> 00:14:00.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We could predict that this would be
better for Ren’s sake,

242
00:14:01.048 --> 00:14:02.508 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and of course, that proved to be true.

243
00:14:03.634 --> 00:14:07.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I believe this was the best outcome.</i>
<i>But Nana…</i>

244
00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:14.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Back then, she could’ve gone</i>
<i>with him if she desired.</i>

245
00:14:14.728 --> 00:14:17.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But rather than choose happiness</i>
<i>as a woman,</i>

246
00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:20.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>she chose to protect her pride.</i>

247
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that’s the reason why she’s
so insistent on succeeding as a musician,

248
00:14:24.321 --> 00:14:25.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
no matter what.

249
00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:27.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She has her heart set on someday reaching

250
00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:30.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the level of success
Ren… Trapnest is enjoying.

251
00:14:31.495 --> 00:14:34.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shin, surpass Ren.

252
00:14:34.832 --> 00:14:38.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sometimes, it pains me
to see her like that.

253
00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:41.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To be honest,

254
00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:44.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not sure whether or not
Nana still has feelings for Ren,

255
00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:48.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but both Yasu and I feel awkward
talking about Ren in front of her.

256
00:14:49.763 --> 00:14:53.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We weren’t necessarily keeping it
a secret from you guys.

257
00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:55.895 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So both of you, there’s no need

258
00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:58.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
for you to act like
you don’t know anything,

259
00:14:58.772 --> 00:15:03.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I don’t want you asking her
about this just to satisfy your curiosity.

260
00:15:05.112 --> 00:15:06.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I understand.

261
00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:12.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But I must’ve mentioned</i>
<i>Ren many times in front on Nana.</i>

262
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:16.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ms. Komatsu! It’s already three o’clock!

263
00:15:16.206 --> 00:15:17.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-<i>Then I was hurting Nana’s pride</i>
-How far did you go for lunch?

264
00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:19.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-<i>every time I mentioned Trapnest.</i>
-My goodness!

265
00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:20.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-<i>Although I knew nothing about this,</i>
-Your stance toward your work

266
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:22.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-<i>I feel bad about it.</i>
-is not right! You’re practically

267
00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:23.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-<i>I’m gonna stop asking her</i>
-stealing your salary

268
00:15:23.505 --> 00:15:24.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-<i>to come to the live concert with me.</i>
-from the company! Excuse me!

269
00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:26.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-<i>Naturally, she won’t wanna go</i>
-Are you listening, Ms. Komatsu?

270
00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:28.469 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>to a Trapnest live concert.</i>

271
00:15:31.263 --> 00:15:33.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s okay
as long as you’re feeling remorse.

272
00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:34.767 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I went a bit too far.

273
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just be careful
this doesn’t happen again, okay?

274
00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:40.606 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>That’s right.</i>
<i>In order not to hurt her again,</i>

275
00:15:40.689 --> 00:15:45.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I’ll cautiously but casually bring up</i>
<i>the subject of Ren.</i>

276
00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:50.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did Yasu come?
-Huh?

277
00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:52.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is Yasu’s, right?

278
00:15:52.701 --> 00:15:54.662 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s no other guy
who would smoke those odd cigarettes

279
00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:55.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with that distinctive smell.

280
00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:58.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So they do have a distinctive smell?

281
00:15:58.582 --> 00:16:00.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I always thought it had
a nice, sweet scent.

282
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.419 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

283
00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:05.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But these aren’t Yasu’s. They’re Shin’s.

284
00:16:05.255 --> 00:16:06.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I confiscated them from him.

285
00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:09.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? What is it with Shin?

286
00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:12.054 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There’s no sense in me holding onto them,

287
00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:13.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so go ahead and smoke them, Nana.

288
00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:16.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I don’t care for these.

289
00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:18.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Leave them here,
and Yasu will smoke them when he’s here.

290
00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:21.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait a minute. When did you see Shin?

291
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.441 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I bumped into him
when I was coming home from work.

292
00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:26.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh?

293
00:16:26.568 --> 00:16:30.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>What am I doing lying to her?</i>
<i>I should just tell her the truth.</i>

294
00:16:31.031 --> 00:16:34.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s something fishy here.
Don’t go after Shin.

295
00:16:34.743 --> 00:16:37.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To him, a working woman is
a woman to get money from,

296
00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:38.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
even if that woman is you.

297
00:16:38.539 --> 00:16:40.332 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s nothing like that.

298
00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:42.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then that’s fine.

299
00:16:43.711 --> 00:16:45.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
By the way, did you call Misato?

300
00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:49.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>It was with the first set of members,</i>
<i>back when Ren was in the band.</i>

301
00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:49.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

302
00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:52.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder if she got back all right.

303
00:16:52.302 --> 00:16:54.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mm-hmm. She said she was
on the train on her way home.

304
00:16:55.597 --> 00:16:56.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m glad to hear that.

305
00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:04.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, Nana, about Ren of Trapnest…

306
00:17:04.148 --> 00:17:06.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is about the live concert, right?
Sure. I’ll go.

307
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Why?

308
00:17:09.778 --> 00:17:12.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told you I’d go if I felt like it.

309
00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:13.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So what made you feel like going?

310
00:17:13.907 --> 00:17:16.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I’d like to come too.

343
00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:44.998 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I’m sure you would. I’m sorry.

00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:49.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I wonder if the reunion will be
as exciting as you’re thinking, Hachi.

345
00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:52.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I agree maybe imagining him
jumping off the stage is a stretch.

346
00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:57.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Still, I wonder
if Ren still thinks about Nana.

347
00:18:57.261 --> 00:18:59.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They haven’t been in touch
for two years, right?

348
00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:03.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. I wonder about that.
To start with, that guy…

349
00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:05.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"To start with that guy," what?

350
00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:07.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rumor has it he’s a real womanizer.

351
00:19:07.229 --> 00:19:08.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

352
00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:11.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, but that’s something from his past.

353
00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:14.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As far as Nana was concerned,
he was very faithful to her.

354
00:19:14.778 --> 00:19:17.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, and that necklace
Ren’s always wearing?

355
00:19:17.906 --> 00:19:20.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana gave that to him.

356
00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:21.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way, really?

357
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s a totally good sign
he still has feelings for her!

358
00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:24.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But maybe he just likes it,

359
00:19:24.788 --> 00:19:26.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and there’s no real reason
behind him wearing it.

360
00:19:26.874 --> 00:19:28.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That can’t be.

361
00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It definitely means something to him.
Hey, Yasu, don’t you agree?

362
00:19:34.089 --> 00:19:36.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I do.

363
00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:37.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

365
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:47.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
