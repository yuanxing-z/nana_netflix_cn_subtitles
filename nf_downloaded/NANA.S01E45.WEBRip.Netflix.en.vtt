56
00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never mind Takumi.

57
00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:29.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can see him any time,
and every inch of him too.

58
00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:30.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you’ve seen enough of him?

59
00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:33.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You see, every time he appears
in front of the media,

60
00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he tries to be cool,
and it’s like he’s a different person.

61
00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:37.652 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I get embarrassed watching him.

62
00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:40.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you were a big fan
of that guy acting cool.

63
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you showing off the fact
you’re close to him now?

64
00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:43.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I can’t help it!

65
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.578 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Takumi’s the closest person to me now!

66
00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:50.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But on that same account,
you’re really close to BLAST, too.

67
00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:54.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you're just like an average fan
when it comes to the guru.

68
00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:56.170 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s really annoying!

69
00:04:57.213 --> 00:05:00.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s because I can only watch Nana
from a distance,

70
00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:03.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I can’t do any more than worry
about her and cheer her on.

71
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:06.306 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Which puts me in practically
the same position as the fans.

72
00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:07.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I find it lonely.

73
00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:10.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I’m sure she’s really busy,

74
00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so she’s not likely to have any time
to be looking after you.

75
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t need her to look after me.

76
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.361 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just feel lonely that
she doesn’t rely on me.

91
00:05:57.356 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really? I think he looks the most normal.

92
00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:02.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

93
00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:06.407 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Trapnest’s music is so dignified,

00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:45.293 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:03.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I won’t lose to some sullen pervert
who casually records everything on video.

208
00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:10.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>They’ll definitely be against it.</i>

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:13.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I said I’ll talk to the agency,</i>
<i>but the president is scary,</i>

210
00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:17.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>and I can’t compete against Ginpei</i>
<i>in either speech or strength.</i>

211
00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:20.322 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nana, once the contract money gets wired
to your account from Gaia,

212
00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:21.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
go and buy yourself a cell phone.

213
00:12:22.032 --> 00:12:23.993 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You should at least send a text message
to Ren from time to time.

214
00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:28.998 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But if I talk this over with Yasu,</i>
<i>I know he’ll help me out.</i>

215
00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:33.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I really can’t do a thing without Yasu.</i>

216
00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:36.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Seriously, it’s inconvenient for work,
so buy one!

217
00:12:36.338 --> 00:12:38.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why don’t you have one
in this day and age?

218
00:12:38.215 --> 00:12:39.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s the big fuss?

219
00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:41.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sure it’ll just be hard on Ren

220
00:12:41.802 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to wait for a message from her
that only comes once in a while.

221
00:12:44.388 --> 00:12:46.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you own a cell phone,
you just get whipped around.

222
00:12:48.517 --> 00:12:52.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>By whom? Hachi? Or that girl next door?</i>

223
00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:56.442 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>A social guy like you can’t hate</i>
<i>cell phones, too.</i>

224
00:12:56.525 --> 00:13:00.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I won’t bug you anymore, so please,</i>
<i>just find someone and be happy.</i>

225
00:13:02.573 --> 00:13:05.701 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Nana didn’t appear to have</i>
<i>much energy tonight.</i>

226
00:13:05.784 --> 00:13:08.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really? She looked like she was beaming
with confidence to me.

227
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.706 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But she looked spaced out
in the back row the whole time.

228
00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:12.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re really observant!

229
00:13:12.666 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was more concerned about Nobu,
who didn’t smile once.

230
00:13:16.587 --> 00:13:18.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I guess if he’s performing
on the same stage as Takumi,

231
00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:20.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
there’s not much to smile about.

232
00:13:21.425 --> 00:13:23.761 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got an e-mail from Nobu the other day.

233
00:13:23.844 --> 00:13:25.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? What did he say?

234
00:13:25.846 --> 00:13:28.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He wanted to properly talk
things over with me.

235
00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:31.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I broke up with Nobu
without saying anything.

236
00:13:31.852 --> 00:13:35.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I don’t know how I should reply.

237
00:13:35.564 --> 00:13:36.982 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it’s already been a month now.

238
00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:39.985 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you never ended it properly with him.

239
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:42.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I figured as much.

240
00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:44.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you were right not to reply.

241
00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:47.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you inadvertently give him any hope,
it would only make things worse for him.

242
00:13:47.701 --> 00:13:51.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if he’s been ignored to that extent,
he’s probably given up and moved on.

243
00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:55.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you know, Jun-chan,

244
00:13:55.292 --> 00:13:58.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to this day, whenever I remember Shoji,
it still hurts.

245
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why are we talking about Shoji
all of a sudden?

246
00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:07.054 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I look back and think calmly
about when he started two-timing me

247
00:14:07.137 --> 00:14:10.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or what he was thinking at the time,

248
00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:14.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I realize I don’t know anything.

249
00:14:16.063 --> 00:14:17.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And what good would knowing do
at this point?

250
00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:19.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s not about what good it’ll do
or anything!

251
00:14:19.733 --> 00:14:21.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it’s because I remain in the dark

252
00:14:21.318 --> 00:14:26.282 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that even the fun times I had
with Shoji are now just painful memories!

253
00:14:26.907 --> 00:14:30.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t know until what point it was real
and when it all became a lie.

254
00:14:30.619 --> 00:14:35.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s not easy to erase the shock
of being betrayed by someone you trusted.

255
00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:40.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So even if Nobu does date someone,

256
00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:43.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he may also be dragging around
painful memories like me.

257
00:14:44.633 --> 00:14:48.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And he’ll likely be seeing Takumi
from time to time.

258
00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:54.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m thinking
the only way I can make amends

259
00:14:55.185 --> 00:14:57.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is to properly talk to Nobu
and have him understand that,

260
00:14:57.771 --> 00:15:00.816 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
although I chose Takumi,
I did truly love him.

261
00:15:01.442 --> 00:15:03.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But maybe that would only
make me feel better.

262
00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:05.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would I be hurting him even more?

263
00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:07.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you think, Jun-chan?

264
00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.993 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s certainly a tough question.

265
00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:15.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I told her to do what she felt was right,
but I’m kind of worried.

266
00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:18.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come to think of it,
Shoji did want to explain things to her.

267
00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:22.588 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Maybe we shouldn’t have stopped him.
-Maybe not.

268
00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:25.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know there isn’t any right answer
in these situations,

269
00:15:25.132 --> 00:15:28.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I have a tendency to give out
advice like I know everything.

270
00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I felt responsible
and was kind of shocked.

271
00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:33.641 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
From now on,
I’ll be careful not to interfere

272
00:15:33.724 --> 00:15:35.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
in other peoples' business.

273
00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t wanna turn
into some nosy old lady.

274
00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:40.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You really have been acting
like an old lady lately.

275
00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:43.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re acting like an old man,
and it’s rubbed off on me!

276
00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:46.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kyosuke-Junko! You’re here.

277
00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.322 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Saying it together makes them sound
like some comedy duo!

278
00:15:48.405 --> 00:15:50.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, well, speak of the devil.

279
00:15:50.532 --> 00:15:51.909 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Were you trash-talking me again?

280
00:15:51.992 --> 00:15:53.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s unusual to see you coming
for a drink, Sachiko.

281
00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:55.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm-hmm! I just got paid,

282
00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I thought why not splurge
every once in a while.

283
00:15:58.123 --> 00:16:00.709 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shoji! You go off spending unnecessarily,

284
00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:02.127 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
yet you’re making Sachiko
watch her spending?

285
00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:04.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You changed your hairstyle again
and to such a stylish color.

286
00:16:05.005 --> 00:16:06.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How much did it cost?

287
00:16:06.173 --> 00:16:09.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I took him to the stylist. I’m sorry.

288
00:16:09.218 --> 00:16:12.638 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t mind what the nosy old lady says.

289
00:16:13.263 --> 00:16:14.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, by the way,

290
00:16:14.556 --> 00:16:17.017 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
did you know there’s a fireworks festival
tomorrow night at Tamagawa?

291
00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:18.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Fireworks in this season?

292
00:16:18.894 --> 00:16:21.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Remember? The one
they were planning in the summer

293
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
got canceled because of the typhoon.

294
00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:23.190 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

295
00:16:23.273 --> 00:16:25.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There were so many requests
from the public to have it,

296
00:16:25.275 --> 00:16:26.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so they decided to do it after all.

297
00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh?

298
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They’ll start the fireworks at 6:15 p.m.

299
00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:32.116 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you’re free, what do you say the four
of us go see it together?

300
00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:34.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sorry, I have work.
-Me too.

301
00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:36.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s good. Then no one will be there
to get in our way.

00:16:37.037 --> 00:16:38.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Nana seems to have
lots of time lately.

303
00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:39.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She might wanna go.

304
00:16:39.748 --> 00:16:42.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t tell her!
What if we bump into each other?

305
00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:44.128 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How should I know?

306
00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:46.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Think for yourself.
