A bad omen.

7
00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:09.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, Nana hasn’t talked like that
lately, has she?

9
00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Before, she would blame everything

10
00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:19.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Perhaps she’s becoming more of an adult.

11
00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:21.766 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

13
00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:28.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sunny-side up.

14
00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:32.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

15
00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:35.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nana doesn’t come by our place

16
00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:39.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t think I’ve seen her

18
00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:43.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, right. You couldn’t make it
to her roommate’s live concert either

19
00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:45.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

20
00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:50.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, she’s doing okay,
but there was something odd about her.

21
00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:54.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. You mean that scent
of a new guy in her life?

22
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

23
00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

25
00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:03.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Judging by the fact
she’s said nothing about it, I doubt it.

26
00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:07.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She said something about wanting
to work in sales at a fancy shop.

27
00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:08.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

28
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:10.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

from her previous job, right?

29
00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:11.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

30
00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:17.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

32
00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:20.116 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:14.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

166
00:10:58.449 --> 00:11:00.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s easily enough food

167
00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:03.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess I got a bit carried away.

168
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.582 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I figured he'd be hungry
after the live performance.

169
00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder what time Ren will be here.

170
00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:12.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? He’s coming? Did he say he is?

171
00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:18.386 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What? I don’t know,
but I assumed he’d be coming. Isn’t he?

172
00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:22.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I doubt he is.
He never made any such promise.

173
00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:26.227 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why not?
-What do you mean, why not?

174
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:27.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
His tour ends today,

175
00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:30.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so wouldn’t he come to see you
first thing after the concert’s over?

176
00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:32.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He hasn’t seen you in a month!

177
00:11:32.483 --> 00:11:33.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

178
00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:36.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But tonight they’re partying until late
to celebrate the end of the tour.

179
00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:39.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s not likely
he’ll be able to come here.

180
00:11:39.281 --> 00:11:41.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

181
00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:43.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

182
00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:46.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

183
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:51.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. If Ren comes over and stays the night,
you’d feel obligated to be hospitable.

184
00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:53.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we decided that from now on,
whenever we wanna meet,

185
00:11:53.712 --> 00:11:56.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll go to Ren’s place.

186
00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s not gonna suddenly show up
late at night without my knowledge.

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:03.764 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

191
00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:14.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

193
00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:19.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t let it get you down.

194
00:12:19.363 --> 00:12:21.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you wanna see Ren,
I’ll ask him to drop by sometime.

195
00:12:22.783 --> 00:12:25.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

196
00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:28.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, if you’d like I’ll have him
invite Takumi again, and…

197
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it’s all right! Don’t worry about me!

198

199
00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:38.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, anyway, I don’t think
he’ll be able to come today.

200
00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:41.302 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m sorry, considering

201
00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:43.554 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s okay. It really is.
Really, don’t worry about it.

202
00:12:43.637 --> 00:12:45.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll just put everything in the fridge.
It’ll last a few days.

203

Sure. Of course you can.

207
00:12:57.359 --> 00:12:59.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll get some plates.

208
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This looks really delicious.

209
00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:05.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ren doesn’t know what he’s missing,
losing out on this great feast.

210
00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:07.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Delicious!

211
00:13:09.413 --> 00:13:12.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, seeing the way
you’re acting, you actually wanted

212
00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to go to the final concert
with everyone tonight, didn’t you?

213
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:19.298 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I should’ve asked Ren about it.

214
00:13:19.381 --> 00:13:22.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m really bad at noticing
that sort of stuff. Sorry.

215
00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:24.553 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s not true.

216
00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:27.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Never mind me.
I bet you wanted to go, didn’t you?

217
00:13:27.264 --> 00:13:29.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can be really stubborn.

218
00:13:30.017 --> 00:13:32.269 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s not really about being stubborn.

219
00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:33.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I saw the performance,

220
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’d end up comparing myself
and get depressed.

221
00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:36.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As shameful as that is…

222
00:13:37.858 --> 00:13:41.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is great too. Looks like
we’ll be enjoying great food for a while.

223
00:13:43.864 --> 00:13:46.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I’m the one who’s lousy</i>

224
00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I’m sorry for forcing</i>

225
00:13:54.375 --> 00:13:57.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much!

226
00:14:08.722 --> 00:14:13.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Today’s performance is now over.</i>

227
00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:16.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

228
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>and promptly leave the premises.</i>

229
00:14:28.909 --> 00:14:30.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m going home.

230
00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:33.706 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Huh? You’re not going?
But our pass allows us to go backstage.

231
00:14:33.789 --> 00:14:35.332 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have work to do.

232
00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never mind that. Just come for a bit.

233
00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:40.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry. Give Ren my regards.

234
00:14:41.005 --> 00:14:42.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about Reira?

235
00:14:46.218 --> 00:14:47.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tell her "Good job."

236
00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:48.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s it?

237
00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:50.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
TRAPNEST'S BACKSTAGE ROOM

238
00:14:50.514 --> 00:14:53.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Where’s Yasu? Isn’t he with you?

239
00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:56.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He left, saying he had work to do.
He sends his regards to Ren.

240
00:14:56.812 --> 00:14:59.315 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Huh? What about me?
-No way!

241
00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:02.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was really looking forward
to seeing him.

242
00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:04.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess it wasn’t mutual, Naoki.

243
00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:09.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was also looking forward
to seeing him. So it wasn’t mutual?

244
00:15:09.783 --> 00:15:10.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is so painful.

245
00:15:10.993 --> 00:15:14.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Reira, you realize it’s hard to come up
with a comeback phrase in your case.

246
00:15:14.663 --> 00:15:16.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It wasn’t mutual? This is so painful.

247
00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not to mention there are writers
around us taking notes.

248
00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:22.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Take, it’s not a laughing matter.

249
00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.591 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yasu asked me to tell you
that you did a good job.

250
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow, what a pretty boy!

251
00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:32.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Come play with me.
-Hey!

252
00:15:33.223 --> 00:15:35.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure, but I’m expensive.

253
00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:37.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One hundred thousand yen per night
for the "works".

254
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:38.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shin!

255
00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:40.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re cute too. How much?

256
00:15:40.397 --> 00:15:42.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ren, save me. What’s up with this person?

257
00:15:43.525 --> 00:15:45.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I'll go home.

258
00:15:45.402 --> 00:15:47.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on. We’re partying. Come join us.

259
00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:50.407 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We’ve got a second and third party
lined up, so we’ll be at it until morning.

260
00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:52.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yay! I’m coming, I’m coming.

261
00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:53.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yay, come, come.

262
00:15:53.577 --> 00:15:55.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I’m coming, I’m coming.

263
00:16:06.048 --> 00:16:07.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gin and tonic.

264
00:16:07.257 --> 00:16:10.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you sure, Nobu?
We’re only at the second party.

265
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shouldn’t you slow down with the drinking?

266
00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:14.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can’t blend in with this atmosphere
unless I’m drunk.

267
00:16:14.098 --> 00:16:16.225 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Such a pure-hearted guy!

268
00:16:17.059 --> 00:16:20.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wonder why Yasu went out
with such a weird woman.

269
00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:21.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Weird woman?

270
00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:23.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The mysteries of Yasu keep building.

271
00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:26.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can’t let you talk like that, Nobu.

272
00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:29.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How dare you talk
about our princess like that.

273
00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:32.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Takumi… Sorry to bother you,
but could you please autograph these?

274
00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What. What’s this? You're making me work,
even in this place?

275
00:16:36.203 --> 00:16:37.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry.

276
00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:40.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I got autographs from the others
during breaks at rehearsals,

277
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:43.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you seemed busy, so I was
gonna ask you later then forgot.

278
00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s a request
from a very important sponsor.

279
00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:48.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, okay. If it’s so important,
then you shouldn’t forget.

280
00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:49.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry.

281
00:16:49.633 --> 00:16:51.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pull yourself together, manager.

282
00:16:52.094 --> 00:16:53.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you’re signing them? Good for you.

283
00:16:53.595 --> 00:16:54.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m a mature man after all.

284
00:16:55.264 --> 00:16:57.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re the one who does
the musical arrangements

285
00:16:57.766 --> 00:16:59.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for all the Trapnest songs, right Takumi?

286
00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:00.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s right.

287
00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:04.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you also produced
your latest album, right?

288
00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:05.190 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, yeah.

289
00:17:05.274 --> 00:17:08.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So that’s why it’s
so much better than the first one.

290
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:11.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh? You’re cute. How about
for two hundred thousand yen?

291
00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:13.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you’re seriously great.

292
00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:15.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How do you manage to make

293
00:17:15.325 --> 00:17:18.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
such fancy music
out of Ren’s dark, twisted songs?

294
00:17:18.787 --> 00:17:20.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Excuse me for writing dark, twisted songs.

295
00:17:21.665 --> 00:17:22.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shochu!

296
00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:25.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it’s all possible
because of Ren’s songs.

297
00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:27.296 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How do you manage
to get on everyone’s good side?

298
00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:29.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
By the way, Takumi,

299
00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:31.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
could you sign an autograph for me, too?

300
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure. But do you have autograph paper?

301
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I don’t. Just give me one of those.

302
00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:38.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But these are for our important sponsors.

303
00:17:38.098 --> 00:17:39.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do I care?

304
00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:40.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>He’s just like Nana.</i>

305
00:17:41.477 --> 00:17:42.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To whom?

306
00:17:42.644 --> 00:17:43.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hachiko.
-Huh?

307
00:17:43.854 --> 00:17:45.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ren, if it’s for Hachi,

308
00:17:45.439 --> 00:17:47.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
why not do the favor of having him
write out her full name?

309
00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:49.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is her full name?

310
00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:53.489 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hachi… Where have I heard that before?

311
00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:55.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You met her a while ago, Takumi.

00:17:55.282 --> 00:17:58.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At the mahjong tournament. Nana Komatsu.

313
00:17:58.118 --> 00:18:00.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yes, Nana.

314
00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:06.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She may no longer want
an autograph from me.

315
00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:08.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? But she said she wanted one.

316
00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:10.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-When?
-The day of the mahjong game.

317
00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:15.469 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then there’s no need.
We did it the next day.

318
00:18:15.552 --> 00:18:17.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where did Take go?

319
00:18:19.473 --> 00:18:22.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait. What do you mean, "You did it"?

320
00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:25.646 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? You want me to explain it to you?

321
00:18:25.729 --> 00:18:27.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She’s my girl’s best friend.

322
00:18:28.065 --> 00:18:30.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s one thing to fool around with women,
but you’ve gone too far.

323
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:33.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Know your limits.
-Don’t get all worked up.

324
00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:37.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s not as if I forced myself onto her.
She agreed to it.

325
00:18:37.241 --> 00:18:39.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She was wagging her tail
looking all pleased.

326
00:18:47.334 --> 00:18:48.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, you!

327
00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:51.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Take, it’s nothing.
They’re just fooling around.

328
00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:56.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you wanna fight, let’s take it outside.

329
00:18:56.426 --> 00:18:59.638 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s a party for all the tour staff.
Don’t spoil it.

330
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:07.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Nobu…
-I’m going home.

331
00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:09.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re going home?

332
00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:13.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Takumi…

333
00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:18.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good job.

334
00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:23.662 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The autographs!

335
00:19:23.745 --> 00:19:25.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you all right, Takumi?

336
00:19:26.707 --> 00:19:29.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Shin is so awesome!
-Don’t laugh, Reira.

337
00:19:29.793 --> 00:19:31.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t get all upset, Takumi.
You’re the one at fault.

338
00:19:31.879 --> 00:19:34.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was just telling the truth!
What’s wrong with that?

339
00:19:35.465 --> 00:19:38.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You think you did
absolutely nothing wrong?

340
00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:40.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m going home too.

341
00:19:41.054 --> 00:19:43.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can’t leave, Takumi.
We’ve still got the third party to go to.

342
00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:44.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Continue without me.

343
00:19:44.391 --> 00:19:45.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Takumi, the autographs…

344
00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:48.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll redo them tomorrow
and send them to you.

345
00:19:48.937 --> 00:19:50.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thanks to this, I just remembered
something important that I must do.

346
00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:52.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? A woman thing again?

347
00:19:52.649 --> 00:19:53.775 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When you see Nobu, tell him that

348
00:19:54.651 --> 00:19:56.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he cannot reach my level
even in a hundred years.

349
00:19:57.237 --> 00:19:59.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He doesn’t have the guts
to make a woman his, so stop fussing.

350
00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:02.534 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I agree with the second half.

351
00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:04.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll give him the message.

352
00:20:22.596 --> 00:20:25.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What is it at this time of night?</i>

353
00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:29.269 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, Hachi…

354
00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:54.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Hey, Nana…</i>

355
00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:58.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Why are having a dream come true</i>
<i>and achieving happiness</i>

356
00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:01.260 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>two different things?</i>

357
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>I still don’t get it, even now.</i>

358
00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:08.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
MAY HACHIKO FIND A BOYFRIEND
(LONG-HAIRED) NANA
