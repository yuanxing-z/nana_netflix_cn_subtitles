00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:58.741 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In the meantime, you will give me details.

208
00:11:01.535 --> 00:11:02.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Matsuda.

209
00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:05.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have you seen Shoji today? Is he not here?

210
00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:08.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. We were together until a moment ago,

211
00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:10.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but we bumped into a girl he knew.

212
00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:13.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They wanted to talk, so I left.

213
00:11:13.964 --> 00:11:14.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh?

214
00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:19.136 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not like that.
I doubt that was his girlfriend.

215
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t worry.

216
00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:25.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Matsuda, I don’t have
special feelings for Shoji.

217
00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:26.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We’re just good friends.

218
00:11:26.894 --> 00:11:31.190 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you saying?
It’s more than obvious.

219
00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:35.361 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, at first,
I thought you two were dating.

220
00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:39.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was really surprised
when I heard that Shoji has a girlfriend.

221
00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:43.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn’t know either until recently.

222
00:11:43.452 --> 00:11:45.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To be honest, I was a bit surprised.

223
00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:47.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you mean? Was he hiding it?

224
00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:49.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He’s the worst!
-That’s not it!

225
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.253 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I assumed on my own that
he didn’t have one!

226
00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:54.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t cover for him. You’re so sweet.

227
00:11:54.463 --> 00:11:56.340 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, have a seat, Sachiko.

228
00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:59.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Forget about Shoji and go out with me.

229
00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:01.262 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, but I’m not attending this class.

230
00:12:01.345 --> 00:12:04.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides, you have a girlfriend back home,
don’t you?

231
00:12:04.348 --> 00:12:05.266 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shoji told me.

232
00:12:05.349 --> 00:12:08.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>That guy. Going around disclosing</i>
<i>other people’s secrets and not his.</i>

233
00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:10.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I’ll get you for this, Shoji.</i>

234
00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:12.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You really are the worst!

235
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have lost all respect for you!

236
00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just didn’t get a chance
to talk about it.

237
00:12:18.487 --> 00:12:20.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I wasn’t necessarily hiding it.
-Don’t make excuses!

238
00:12:20.906 --> 00:12:23.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were planning on two-timing them,
weren't you?

239
00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:26.620 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Junko! Do you think I’m capable
of doing something like that?

240
00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:29.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course not!

241
00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:33.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yet you got greedy and ended up
breaking somebody's heart.

242
00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you think… she’s hurt?

243
00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:39.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course she’s hurt!
Sachiko’s in love with you, right?

244
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But maybe I’m just hoping that she is.

245
00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:45.764 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She hasn’t actually told me
that she likes me.

246
00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:47.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And nothing has changed since.

247
00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:49.393 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We still continue seeing each other
as no more than friends.

248
00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:53.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your intellectual level has remained
the same since junior high.

249
00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:57.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-This is nonsense!
-Junko! Don’t talk to me like that!

250
00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What should I do to make things right?

251
00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:02.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have to put an end to this.

252
00:13:02.531 --> 00:13:04.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you keep spending time with her,

253
00:13:04.825 --> 00:13:07.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you’ll continue hurting her
until it becomes unbearable.

254
00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:12.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But we attend the same classes,
and we work at the same workplace.

255
00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How am I supposed to put an end to it?

256
00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:16.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, before you
concern yourself with Sachiko,

257
00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:18.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
shouldn’t you be thinking
about Nana instead?

258
00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:19.715 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

259
00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:21.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So Sachiko’s more important
to you than Nana.

260
00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:23.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s not true!

261
00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I haven’t done anything that
needs explaining to Nana.

262
00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:29.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But Nana seems to suspect you and Sachiko.

263
00:13:29.892 --> 00:13:33.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Huh?
-I heard her mumbling about Sachiko.

264
00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:35.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She said something about her working
for her Demon Lord or something.

265
00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:38.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh. You’ve got it wrong.
That’s the virtual Sachiko.

266
00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:41.403 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? What do you mean, virtual Sachiko?

267
00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:45.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have no idea. In fact, I’d like to know.

268
00:13:45.282 --> 00:13:46.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, Shoji,

269
00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:49.578 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can perfectly understand that
you’re exhausted being with Nana,

270
00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:51.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and you look for comfort through Sachiko.

271
00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:55.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Comfort?
-That’s it, Junko. That’s exactly it.

272
00:13:55.459 --> 00:13:57.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I feel comfort whenever I’m with Sachiko.

273
00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.881 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you knew that Nana’s
an exhausting woman in that way

274
00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:02.508 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and still you went after her.

275
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:04.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So don’t run away now.
Diligently stick with her!

276
00:14:04.468 --> 00:14:05.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course, that’s what I intend to do!

277
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.306 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m committed in this relationship
enough to make Nana my wife.

278
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Eventually, I wanna share
a grave with her.

279
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re taking this too far.

280
00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:13.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’ll never rest in peace

281
00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:15.938 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if you die with that believer
of the Demon Lord.

282
00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:19.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Junko! Whose side are you on?

283
00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:24.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Neither really.
You could say I’m on the side of justice.

284
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:29.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>What does she mean, justice?</i>
<i>She’s making fun of me.</i>

285
00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:30.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>This coming from a former delinquent.</i>

286
00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:33.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One day, I’m gonna show everyone
pictures of you from junior high.

287
00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:50.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you here?

288
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shoji… Thank goodness.
I was looking for you.

289
00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:56.061 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here’s the book I borrowed.

290
00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:58.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wanted to hurry and return it to you.

291
00:14:58.314 --> 00:14:59.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much.

292
00:14:59.773 --> 00:15:02.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh. Anytime would’ve been fine.

293
00:15:02.192 --> 00:15:03.193 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You could’ve even given it to me at work.

294
00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:05.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re right. I’m sorry.

295
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, there’s no need to apologize.

296
00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:14.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, how long have you been standing here?

297
00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:17.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to eavesdrop,

298
00:15:17.666 --> 00:15:21.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but given the content
of the conversation, I just froze.

299
00:15:21.503 --> 00:15:23.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Never mind that!
How long have you been here?

300
00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:25.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course she’s hurt!

301
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:27.426 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sachiko’s in love with you, right?

302
00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:31.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shoji! I’m sorry. Are you all right?

303
00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:34.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, yeah. Just so we’re clear,

304
00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:36.393 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn’t stumble like that to try
and make you laugh or anything.

305
00:15:36.477 --> 00:15:38.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m really sorry.

306
00:15:38.395 --> 00:15:41.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, Sach… you don’t have to apologize.

307
00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:43.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m the one at fault.

308
00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:46.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m at fault! Bye!

309
00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:50.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>This is bad. This is worse than bad.</i>
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>

310
00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:53.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I have to think this through seriously.</i>

311
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you keep spending time with her,

312
00:15:55.704 --> 00:15:57.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you’ll continue hurting her
until it becomes unbearable.

313
00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it would be cowardly

314
00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:01.669 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to run away from it like this,
right, Koichi Sato?

315
00:16:01.752 --> 00:16:04.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Huh?
-Nothing. I’m talking to myself.

316
00:16:04.421 --> 00:16:07.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What do you mean?
After calling a person by his full name.

317
00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:09.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides, Shoji,
I thought you had class today.

318
00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:11.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you’re already cutting class
to come here and drink at this early hour,

319
00:16:12.054 --> 00:16:13.806 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’d say your future isn’t looking
too good.

320
00:16:13.889 --> 00:16:17.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s right.
What am I doing here at Jackson’s?

321
00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:20.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I see. So this is what escaping
from one’s troubles is like.

322
00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:23.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I’m already running away.

323
00:16:29.196 --> 00:16:31.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>So Sachiko’s more important</i>
<i>to you than Nana.</i>

324
00:16:32.282 --> 00:16:33.909 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re wrong!

325
00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Koichi Sato, I’m going to work!

326
00:16:36.203 --> 00:16:38.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m gonna break ties with her!

327
00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:42.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll do whatever it takes
to be with Nana forever.

328
00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:49.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Ever since I first met her,</i>

329
00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:52.011 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I was planning not to hang out</i>

330
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>So what am I doing,</i>
<i>feeling comforted by her?</i>

331
00:16:55.931 --> 00:16:59.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>That’s exactly what the Demon Lord wants.</i>

332
00:16:59.309 --> 00:17:00.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>It won’t happen.</i>

333
00:17:16.618 --> 00:17:19.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I definitely won’t betray Nana.</i>

334
00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:26.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why are you changing into your sneakers,
Ms. Kawamura?

335
00:17:26.128 --> 00:17:28.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because I have to run for the last train.

336
00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:30.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right. That makes sense.

337
00:17:38.932 --> 00:17:41.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sorry to keep you. Let’s hurry.
-Wait, Sachiko!

338
00:17:42.853 --> 00:17:43.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have to talk to you about something.

339
00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Don’t make such a face.</i>
<i>I won’t look at her face.</i>

340
00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:58.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll talk as we walk,
so will you please listen?

341
00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:01.914 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we miss the last train,
I’ll pay for a taxi.

342
00:18:20.682 --> 00:18:22.893 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>So, how am I supposed to end this?</i>

343
00:18:22.976 --> 00:18:25.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What am I supposed to tell her? How?</i>

344
00:18:25.229 --> 00:18:27.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>She’s my friend</i>

345
00:18:27.147 --> 00:18:29.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>So asking her to break up with me</i>
<i>would be odd.</i>

346
00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:30.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Do I say we’re no longer friends?</i>

347
00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:32.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>But why should I have to say that?</i>

348
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Sachiko hasn’t done anything wrong.</i>

349
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Or rather, she’s a really great girl.</i>

350
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

351
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Anyway, I must say something.</i>

352
00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:43.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know…

353
00:18:57.302 --> 00:19:01.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sorry. I’m really sorry.
-You’ve done nothing wrong, Shoji.

354
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I jumped to conclusions on my own
and got carried away.

355
00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:11.775 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will be careful not to interfere.

356
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I will never interfere
in your relationship with your girlfriend.

357
00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:24.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So… please… Can’t we at least be friends?

358
00:19:25.205 --> 00:19:27.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t ask me to end this.

359
00:19:42.222 --> 00:19:43.891 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s strange.

360
00:19:43.974 --> 00:19:45.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

361
00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:48.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shoji should be done with work,
but I get his answering machine.

362
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did he forget to turn his phone on?

363
00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:53.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want to hurry and tell him
that I got a new job.

364
00:19:53.692 --> 00:19:55.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He’s probably cheating on you.

365
00:19:55.402 --> 00:19:58.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shoji wouldn’t do such a thing!
I’ll send him an email.

366
00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:03.243 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wonder what kind of company would hire
a woman like you…

367
00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They must really be understaffed.

368
00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:08.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you know, I’ll learn the job
while doing errands,

369
00:20:08.123 --> 00:20:11.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and if I am fully capable,
they’ll hire me permanently.

370
00:20:11.084 --> 00:20:13.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I’ll do my best.

371
00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:15.881 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow. You seem awfully motivated.

372
00:20:15.964 --> 00:20:19.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I work hard, I will get a bonus,

373
00:20:19.092 --> 00:20:21.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which will get me a step closer
to buying a house with a yard.

374
00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:25.641 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A house with a yard? Is that your dream?

375
00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:27.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yup! A great big dream!

376
00:20:29.603 --> 00:20:32.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then I’ll build you a home
with the money I get from my songs.

377
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:33.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

378
00:20:35.859 --> 00:20:38.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But your room will be the doghouse.

379
00:20:42.157 --> 00:20:43.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>If Nana was a guy,</i>

00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:46.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:54.419 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:54.503 --> 00:20:58.507 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

384
00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:02.386 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Because love and pain go hand in hand.</i>

385
00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
