00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:57.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
at least be smart enough to use an alias.

47
00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:02.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

48
00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:04.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not that I care if people find out,

49
00:05:04.887 --> 00:05:08.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

50
00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then don’t do things to make people worry.

51
00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:15.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can put up a front as you like,
but you’re still a fifteen-year-old kid.

00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:17.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’ll need a guardian
to sign on your behalf

53
00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:19.694 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

54

I’ll go and get that signature for you.

57
00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:42.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

58
00:05:42.633 --> 00:05:45.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, I’ve got a lot of work to do.

59
00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:47.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s fine. I don’t mind, but…

60
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Does that mean you’ve accepted defeat
in that bet you made?

61
00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:53.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hachiko already has a boyfriend,
so are you all right with that?

62
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:55.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or rather, is Nobu all right with that?

63
00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:57.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I dunno.

64
00:05:57.148 --> 00:06:00.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, a man becomes weak
toward the woman he loves,

65
00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:04.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I just can’t understand what goes on
in the complicated mind of a woman.

66
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In other words,
it’s a complicated situation, isn't it?

67
00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:11.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry. I’ll try to be more discreet.

68
00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:18.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

69
00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

70
00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.340 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. There’s no need to worry.

71
00:06:23.424 --> 00:06:24.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

72
00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:25.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

73

74
00:06:33.267 --> 00:06:34.393 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s a secret.

78
00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:55.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

79
00:07:00.002 --> 00:07:01.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

89
00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can’t tell.

90
00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:51.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I kind of feel a connection.

91
00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:53.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

92
00:07:53.347 --> 00:07:55.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have no clue what you’re getting at,

93
00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:56.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so if possible, can you explain it to me?

94
00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:57.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Telepathy?

95
00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:58.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

96
00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:03.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sorry, I have a tendency
to get carried away.

97
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:07.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, it’s ok. Actually I find
that dreamy side of you quite attractive.

98
00:08:07.695 --> 00:08:10.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is he disappointed? What should I do?

99
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Say, that method you use
where you seem interested

100
00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:13.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

101
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:15.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is that a trap to get a man
to fall for you?

102
00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:16.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No!

103
00:08:16.412 --> 00:08:17.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You seem carefree,
but you’re really cunning.

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:19.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You’re wrong!
-What a terrible woman.

105
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did the Demon Lord send you?

106
00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s why you talk passionately
about him like some missionary!

107
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s not true!

108
00:08:23.544 --> 00:08:26.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You said so yourself,
that you’re a horrible woman…

109
00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was joking. Don’t cry!

110
00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:35.556 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry. I’ll break it off with Takumi.

111
00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:42.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I really didn’t want anyone to know
about what happened with Takumi.

112
00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:45.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought I could act
like nothing happened

113
00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.568 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and become your girlfriend.

114
00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:53.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had such cunning thoughts. Lots of them.

115
00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:56.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you disappointed?

116
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. I’m happy.

117
00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.711 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop staring at me with those teary eyes.

118
00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I won’t be able to hold back.

119
00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:15.972 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't take you from him by force.

120
00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:19.767 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can’t have you do something
that’ll make you a horrible woman.

121
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If we let things get outta control now,

122
00:09:24.355 --> 00:09:25.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you’ll end up being trapped
between Takumi and me,

123
00:09:25.856 --> 00:09:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and you’ll suffer.

124
00:09:28.442 --> 00:09:31.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because you’re kind and fragile.

125
00:09:32.488 --> 00:09:38.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t find you cunning.
Don’t be so hard on yourself.

126
00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:42.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It can’t be helped that
you’re attracted to Takumi.

127
00:09:43.624 --> 00:09:44.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No matter how hard I try,

128
00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:47.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll probably never be able
to compete with him.

129
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:48.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s not true! I--

130
00:09:49.046 --> 00:09:49.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But if you

131
00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:54.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
really do break it off with him
and be my woman…

132
00:09:55.886 --> 00:09:58.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll do everything I can
to make you happy.

133
00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:07.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For the sake of your happiness,
I will do everything within my power.

134
00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:13.029 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

135
00:10:14.488 --> 00:10:18.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, with you by my side,
I feel like I can do anything.

136
00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:23.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But it’s a dream that</i>

137
00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:27.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When you break up with Takumi…

138
00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:31.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and sort out your feelings…
then come to me.

139
00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:34.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll be waiting faithfully.

140

145

146
00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:11.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Welcome back, Ms. Hachiko.

147
00:11:11.712 --> 00:11:13.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry for getting back so late.

148
00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:14.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s okay.

149
00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:15.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Actually, you’re early.</i>

150
00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:18.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you alone?

151
00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:19.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Where are Shin and Yasu?

152
00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:21.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, they went home already.

153
00:11:21.305 --> 00:11:24.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What the heck?
And I bought all this for them!

154
00:11:25.434 --> 00:11:28.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m sorry.
Let’s save that for the next party.

155
00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:29.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
By the way, where’s Nobu?

156
00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.775 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He walked me here,

157
00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:35.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but he said he was going home
because he has work tomorrow.

158
00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that so?

159
00:11:37.613 --> 00:11:39.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

160
00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I guess we can call it a day.

161
00:11:41.784 --> 00:11:43.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m working from the morning too.

162
00:11:43.452 --> 00:11:44.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you mind if I take a bath first?

163
00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:46.997 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh! Nana’s in there right now.

164
00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I figured you would barge in here.

165
00:11:52.628 --> 00:11:54.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’ve gotta do something
about that peeping hobby of yours.

166
00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:57.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Nana.</i>

167
00:12:01.303 --> 00:12:04.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t get in!
What the hell are you thinking?

168
00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:06.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s the big deal? We’re both girls.

169
00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:08.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m not into taking baths
with other women!

170
00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:09.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you would with a man?

171
00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:11.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That’s normal.
-It’s usually the other way around.

172
00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:13.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides, it would be one thing
to share a bath with a human girl,

173
00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but this is a female dog that
just got back from a walk.

174
00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait, Nana.

175
00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:18.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Listen. It’s about Nobu.

176
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about Nobu?

177
00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:40.384 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He asked me to go see
the fireworks with him.

178
00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:45.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then go.

179
00:12:45.764 --> 00:12:49.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Is he still in elementary school?</i>

180
00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:53.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In any case, Yasu won the bet.
No wonder he's the leader.

181
00:12:53.397 --> 00:12:55.357 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He knows everything

182
00:12:56.859 --> 00:13:01.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:13:04.658 --> 00:13:07.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

192
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:54.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
some <i>mosquitoes</i> have taken

193
00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:55.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

194
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Your place too, Takumi? Darn.

195
00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:01.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was all excited because it was

196
00:14:01.465 --> 00:14:02.591 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing to be excited about!

197
00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:05.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mosquitoes? It’s summer after all.

199
00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:09.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They’re at my place, too. The paparazzi.

200
00:14:09.598 --> 00:14:11.642 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

201
00:14:11.725 --> 00:14:14.770 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

This is bad.

202
00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:16.021 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

205
00:14:19.191 --> 00:14:21.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Make her go home before they find out.

206
00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can't afford for you

Actually, I wanna go to your place
and make something!

315
00:19:57.321 --> 00:19:58.780 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? My place?

316
00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:00.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No good!
-Why not?

317
00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:02.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told you yesterday.

318
00:20:02.242 --> 00:20:03.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Put an end to things first,
and then come to me.

319
00:20:03.952 --> 00:20:05.871 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I did. That’s why I came.

320
00:20:05.954 --> 00:20:06.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Too fast!

321
00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:10.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m sorry.
But I was holding back all day today.

322
00:20:10.918 --> 00:20:13.545 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The day seemed like a year to me.

323
00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:17.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It might’ve felt like a year to you,
but one day is still one day.

324
00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:19.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I’ll try and wait for one more day.

325
00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:23.972 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Can you cook meat and potato stew?
-It’s my specialty!

326
00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:28.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>She’s so cute! Let’s just pretend</i>

327
00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:30.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where’s Hachiko?

328
00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:32.606 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She said she may not be coming home today.

329
00:20:32.689 --> 00:20:34.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got an email from her.

330
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:36.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You think she’s
at her boyfriend’s place again?

331
00:20:36.151 --> 00:20:39.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What? But I thought
they’re filming until midnight.

332
00:20:41.531 --> 00:20:43.909 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

335
00:20:53.835 --> 00:20:59.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I should’ve asked you then.</i>
