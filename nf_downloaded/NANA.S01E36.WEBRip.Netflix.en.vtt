00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you drunk already?

104
00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:09.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There’s no use trying anymore for this.

105
00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:13.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shin, are you at all serious
about doing this?

106
00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:16.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>You’ve gotta realize that</i>

107
00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:20.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>the company’s not about to invest</i>

108
00:08:20.708 --> 00:08:25.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They say Gaia’s not about to invest money
in an old-fashioned punk band like ours.

109
00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:31.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you mean?

110
00:08:32.094 --> 00:08:33.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who said that?

111
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I am really sorry.</i>

112
00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:36.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
RESTAURANT YAZAWA

113
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m sorry it’s not going anywhere,
all due to my lack of ability.

114
00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:41.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s not your fault, Mr. Kawano.

115
00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:43.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Our band just doesn’t have what it takes.

116
00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:48.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, your band is not the problem.

117
00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:51.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Due to the recession,
Gaia is reluctant to promote new bands.

118
00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:57.328 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is a tough time for bands in general.

119
00:08:57.411 --> 00:09:03.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Trapnest’s album has sold
almost three million copies.

120
00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:05.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I guess a big part of their success
lies with their vocalist Reira.

121
00:09:05.753 --> 00:09:09.340 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She is attractive enough
to ride the diva boom.

122
00:09:09.423 --> 00:09:12.176 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m worthless unless I sing.

123
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:17.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But the same goes for your vocalist, Nana.

124
00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:20.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m not about to give up, Yasu.

125
00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:25.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We’re not giving up that easily either.

126
00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:29.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then will you give me a bit more time?

127
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our temporary contract is
for three months, right?

128
00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:36.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We signed the contract
because we trust you, Mr. Kawano.

129
00:09:36.367 --> 00:09:37.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We’ll keep our promise.

130
00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:39.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really? Thank you.

131
00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I should be thanking you.

132
00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:45.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I appreciate that you put
this much heart into this.

133
00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:49.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you can’t do business on heart alone.

134
00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:59.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I have no desire to turn music
into a heartless business.

135
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In our band, we have people
like Nana and Shin

136
00:10:03.894 --> 00:10:08.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who have had the misfortune
of not being loved by those around them.

137
00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:09.775 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t want them thinking

138
00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:14.572 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
this world is nothing
but money and greed after all.

139
00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:19.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I’m sure there will be
many more situations in the future

140
00:10:19.368 --> 00:10:21.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when they will be forced
to think that way.

141
00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:25.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it would be so encouraging
to have someone like you

142
00:10:25.207 --> 00:10:29.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who will support our band
with passion and love.

143
00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it too much to ask?

144
00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:38.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The burden you carry
on your shoulders seems too greater.

145
00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:44.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let me carry half of it.
Don’t try to carry all that you can.

146
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If both your hands are full,

147
00:10:46.687 --> 00:10:49.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you won’t be able to take action
when you need to.

148
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here.

149
00:10:53.861 --> 00:10:55.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess you’re right.

150
00:11:20.888 --> 00:11:22.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you still drinking, Nobu?

151
00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:25.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How could I not drink?
Who cares about the recession?

152
00:11:26.477 --> 00:11:28.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It feels like I’ve been laid off.

153
00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:30.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have Hachi comfort you.

154
00:11:35.736 --> 00:11:38.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can’t blame it on the recession.

155
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just need to write songs that
will convince the guys at Gaia.

156
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give me that!

157
00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:52.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Say, did something happen
between you and Hachi, Nobu?

158
00:11:52.753 --> 00:11:55.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nobody talks about Hachi
anymore at the studio.

159
00:11:56.006 --> 00:12:00.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shin,
don’t you ever mention that name again.

160
00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:03.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even Nobu has a thing or two
he would rather not talk about.

161
00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:15.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By the way, why did you buy
this acoustic guitar?

162
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:18.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No real reason. I’m going out.

163
00:12:18.737 --> 00:12:23.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Must be nice. The little boy has
many older women to comfort him,

164
00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:25.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
even one who would buy him a guitar.

165
00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:26.829 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I bought it on my own.

166
00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:29.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you bought it with the money
you got from women, right?

167
00:12:29.206 --> 00:12:30.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s the same thing.

168
00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:31.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana…

169
00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:34.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you get everything
you want so easily,

170
00:12:34.795 --> 00:12:37.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you lose that hungry spirit within you.

171
00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:39.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"There’s no use trying"?

172
00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:42.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you have the time to play
your acoustic guitar,

173
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.555 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
practice the bass.

174
00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:49.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I shouldn’t have to be lectured
by some vocalist

175
00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:51.395 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
who can’t even stop smoking.

176
00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:53.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-Ah, Nana!

177
00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:56.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Same goes for you, Nana.
Where did you get your new guitar?

178
00:12:56.734 --> 00:12:59.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s not something
you could buy with your pay.

179
00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:02.990 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it’s unsuitable for someone
like you who can hardly play it.

180
00:13:03.073 --> 00:13:04.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I borrowed it from Ren!

181
00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:06.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then what about those clothes?

182
00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:10.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're all from Misato and Ren, right?

183
00:13:12.666 --> 00:13:13.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana!

184
00:13:14.543 --> 00:13:15.711 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s wrong with that?

185
00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:17.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t compare me with someone
like you who sells his body!

186
00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:18.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t be provoked!

187
00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:20.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m the one
who doesn’t wanna be compared with you.

188
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I receive what’s appropriate
for my efforts.

189
00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:27.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Nana, all you’re doing is cuddling up
to Ren’s kindness.

190
00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:28.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shin!

191
00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:44.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That guy…
Is he going through a rebellious phase?

192
00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:47.785 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wh-- Why are you taking your clothes off?

193
00:13:52.873 --> 00:13:54.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Damn it!

194
00:13:58.712 --> 00:13:59.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it wrong?

195
00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:04.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it wrong to accept kindness?

196
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, there’s nothing wrong about that.

197
00:14:07.471 --> 00:14:12.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t worry about it, okay?
Shin’s only trying to justify himself.

198
00:14:12.309 --> 00:14:16.188 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you should let Ren spoil you more.

199
00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:19.024 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t let some stupid pride
force you into a corner.

200
00:14:30.244 --> 00:14:32.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
REN

201
00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:34.832 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello.

202
00:14:34.915 --> 00:14:38.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Nobu. Sorry to call you at this hour.

203
00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:41.171 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Were you asleep?
-No, I’m still up.

204
00:14:41.255 --> 00:14:42.798 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Things going well?
-Yeah.

205
00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:44.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you sure about that?

206
00:14:44.675 --> 00:14:48.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s no way you don’t know
about Hachiko, right?

207
00:14:49.513 --> 00:14:51.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. But…

208
00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:54.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess it can’t be helped.

209
00:14:55.686 --> 00:14:58.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Honestly, there’s nothing I can do
for her right now…

210
00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:02.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you’re finally able
to face the reality.

211
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:05.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Try to understand the trouble your folks
went through to raise you, okay?

212
00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:07.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, I’m sorry.

213
00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:10.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re being too obedient.
You’re no fun to tease.

214
00:15:12.828 --> 00:15:16.332 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
By the way, Nana’s at my place right now.

215
00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:19.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? She’s at your place?

216
00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.046 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was getting worried
because I can’t reach her on her cell

217
00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:25.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-and she hasn’t replied to my emails.
-<i>Huh?</i>

218
00:15:25.132 --> 00:15:28.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really? Maybe she’s forgotten
to switch it on.

219
00:15:28.969 --> 00:15:32.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>After band practice, Nana, Shin</i>

220
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Actually, Ren…</i>
<i>Nana’s been acting a bit strange lately.</i>

221
00:15:42.691 --> 00:15:49.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She’s always been short-tempered,
but her mood swings are intense.

222
00:15:49.156 --> 00:15:50.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even just now,
she got into an argument with Shin.

223
00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:51.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She got all panicky and started crying.

224
00:15:52.868 --> 00:15:55.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Also, she told me not to tell anyone,</i>
<i>but at one point,</i>

225
00:15:56.246 --> 00:15:59.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
she said she sometimes can’t remember
what she’s been doing.

226
00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:08.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, she has been acting a bit strange.

227
00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:10.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

228
00:16:11.595 --> 00:16:13.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana, get up!

229
00:16:15.599 --> 00:16:17.559 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At least put your clothes on.

230
00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:20.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shut up.

231
00:16:20.604 --> 00:16:22.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you’re a man, come at me.

232
00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:24.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Show me what you’re made of.

233
00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ren said he’s coming to pick you up.

234
00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If he sees you like that,
he’ll get the wrong idea.

235
00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:30.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He should be here any time now.

236
00:16:30.739 --> 00:16:31.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He doesn’t have to come!

237
00:16:31.907 --> 00:16:33.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why not? Please, get dressed!

238
00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:36.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What if he gets followed by a mosquito?
That’ll be trouble.

239
00:16:38.205 --> 00:16:39.206 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A mosquito?

240
00:16:39.289 --> 00:16:42.501 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, the paparazzi are after us!
Naoki was saying so.

241
00:16:42.584 --> 00:16:44.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So there’s no doubt about it.

242
00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:46.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I’m sure it’s fine.

243
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it weren’t, I doubt Ren would say
he’d come pick you up.

244
00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:52.386 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He has no idea the damage
a scandal can cause!

245
00:16:52.469 --> 00:16:54.638 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He kept calling me to his place

246
00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:56.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
without saying a word
about being targeted.

247
00:16:58.267 --> 00:17:01.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He only thinks of himself.

248
00:17:01.186 --> 00:17:04.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t wanna draw attention
as "Ren’s girl."

249
00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:09.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Return the guitar to him.

250
00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:11.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And tell him that
I won’t be seeing him for a while.

251
00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.741 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is your pride that important to you?

252
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ren needs you, you know.

253
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:22.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re the one who’s only thinking
about yourself.
