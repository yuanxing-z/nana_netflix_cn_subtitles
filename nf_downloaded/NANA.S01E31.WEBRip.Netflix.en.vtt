PLEASE RECORD "HUTCH" FOR ME.

You’re the one who called me over!

8
00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:11.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you videotape it?

9
00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:15.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You keep making such dumb excuses
to get me to come over every day!

10
00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you mean dumb excuses?

11
00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:20.306 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We were both orphans, too.

12
00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:23.393 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Watch it, and you’re sure to be in tears.

13
00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cry on your own! I’m going to sleep.

14
00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:28.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

16
00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fine. Sorry if I made you worry.

17
00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:35.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it’s just
the summer heat getting to me,

18
00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:38.116 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I’ll go see a doctor just in case.

19
00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’d better get well soon,
or I won’t be able to go to work, right?

20
00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:43.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s a good idea! I’ll come with you!

21
00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:44.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you saying?

22
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You need to stay here
and finish your homework today.

23
00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:51.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please don’t remind me!

24
00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:57.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, stay focused.
I’ll help you when I get back.

25
00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:58.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you so much.

26
00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:04.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Also, please don’t tell Nana or the others
that I’m not feeling well, okay?

27
00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:05.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s an important time for them
with their debut coming up,

28
00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I don’t want them worrying about me.

29
00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:12.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I’ll be returning home tomorrow.
Will you be all right on your own?

30
00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You should at least talk with Ms. Nana
and have her look after you.

31
00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks, but I’ll be all right.

Ms. Komatsu. Ms. Nana Komatsu.

34
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your urine test came back positive.
When was your last period?

35
00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:41.638 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
July 16th. It lasted about five days.

36
00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:46.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Should you be pregnant,
are you planning on keeping it?

37
00:03:56.694 --> 00:03:59.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We’ll begin with a pelvic examination.
The next room please.

38
00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:01.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please come in, Ms. Komatsu.

39
00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:12.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please take off your underwear
and sit on the examination table.

40
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:17.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You may keep your skirt on.
-Ah, yes.

41
00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:29.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I don't deal well</i>
<i>with inconveniences like that.</i>

42
00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:40.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ms. Komatsu, please relax.

43
00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:48.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I’ll be waiting faithfully.</i>

44
00:04:56.045 --> 00:04:57.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You are pregnant.

45
00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:02.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This small black circle you see
is the sack that contains your baby.

46
00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:06.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the little dot you see
inside is your baby.

47
00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:10.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, we count the first week
from the day of your last period

48
00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
as week zero,

49
00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:15.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so you're in the middle
of your sixth week.

50
00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you’re planning on keeping your child,

51
00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:21.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
come for another check-up in two weeks.

52
00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:22.739 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you wish to have an abortion,

53
00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:26.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the sooner the better,
for your body’s sake.

54
00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:31.539 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would you like to take home the photo?

55
00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:48.806 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

56
00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:54.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? He grew up abroad? Where?

57
00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:59.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn’t get around to asking him.
So you didn’t know either.

58
00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:00.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you know about it?

59
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. I heard about it from Misato as well
and was surprised at first.

60
00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:06.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But thinking back, for one,

61
00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.867 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he didn’t know
about the Tanabata festivities.

62
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This explains some things
I thought were odd about him.

63
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I guess so.

64
00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But if his parents are Japanese,

65
00:06:14.832 --> 00:06:16.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’d think they would’ve at least
told him about Tanabata.

66
00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:18.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you ready to order?

67
00:06:19.253 --> 00:06:21.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Have you decided, Ms. Hachiko?
-Yeah.

68
00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll have the grapefruit juice.

69
00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:25.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Aren’t you eating?
-I’m not hungry.

70
00:06:26.427 --> 00:06:30.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really? Also two mixed sandwiches
and two café au laits.

71
00:06:30.848 --> 00:06:31.891 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right.

72
00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:37.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ms. Nana, would it be possible for you

73
00:06:37.688 --> 00:06:40.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to return to your home
for a while starting tonight?

74
00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:44.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The truth is, Ms. Hachiko
hasn’t been feeling well lately.

75
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really? Is that why you look like
you're under the weather?

76
00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:49.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, but it’s just the summer heat.
I’m all right.

77
00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The doctor said so, too.

78
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's bad enough that
you had to see a doctor?

79
00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:54.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s definitely not all right!

80
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the doctor said I’m fine,
so it’s all right.

81
00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:59.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s not the issue here.

82
00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:04.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right, Misato. I’ll return home
starting tonight, so don’t worry.

83
00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:06.467 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. Thank you very much.

84
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, going back to what
I was saying about Shin…

85
00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:15.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I assumed he was half-Japanese.
So without thinking, I told him

86
00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:20.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wasn't convinced that
his parents were both Japanese.

87
00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:24.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then he told me
he wasn't convinced either,

88
00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:27.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that his parents
shouldn’t have given birth to him.

89
00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ms. Hachiko and I were discussing that.

90
00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:36.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That sort of thinking is like him
denying his own existence.

91
00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I’ll come back to get you, Nana, okay?</i>

92
00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll be back soon.

93
00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:58.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. Denying his parents
and denying his own existence

94
00:07:58.227 --> 00:07:59.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
are two different issues.

95
00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:03.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shin’s not a kid anymore.

96
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:06.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He should be capable of figuring out
why he deserves to exist.

97
00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:08.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think so?

98
00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:10.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If we put our minds to it,

99
00:08:10.948 --> 00:08:13.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we're all capable of determining
our own fates.

100
00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right now,
his purpose in life is to work hard

101
00:08:16.704 --> 00:08:17.955 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
toward the band’s debut.

102
00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:20.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re right! A purpose in life!

103
00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Here you are.

Ever since I found my purpose in life,

105
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.296 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to become a diehard BLAST fan,
my life has been nothing but roses.

106
00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:26.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Roses?

107
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well then, Ms. Nana, Ms. Hachiko…

108
00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:36.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am really grateful for your hospitality.

109
00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:39.018 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please give my regards
to the band members.

110
00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:43.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Take care, Misato.
Come stay with us again anytime.

111
00:08:44.565 --> 00:08:48.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We’ll definitely become
Japan’s number one band…

112
00:08:49.153 --> 00:08:50.780 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for the sake of your purpose in life, too.

113
00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:58.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you crying for?

114
00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:01.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You made her cry on purpose.
Come on, Nana!

115
00:09:01.999 --> 00:09:04.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Misato, you would always come</i>

116
00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>ever since you were in junior high school.</i>

117
00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:09.757 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

118
00:09:11.467 --> 00:09:13.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Back home, you probably</i>

119
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

120
00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:21.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

121
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:24.188 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

123
00:09:27.858 --> 00:09:30.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Please understand that, Misato.</i>

124
00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:37.076 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, regarding the situation
with Shin’s family…

125
00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:38.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Am I the only one who believes
Shin was probably a child

126
00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:40.663 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that resulted
from his mother’s affair abroad,

127
00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:43.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
leading to his family falling apart?

128
00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:48.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder. It certainly seems possible.

129
00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:51.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But why did she have the baby?

130
00:09:51.465 --> 00:09:54.176 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's such a gamble not knowing
who the father is.

131
00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:57.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even if the guy she was having
the affair with was using protection,

132
00:09:57.847 --> 00:09:59.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you can never really be sure, can you?

133
00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:03.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When people get carried away
with passion and lose reason,

134
00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you’re not always as careful
as you should be.

135
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Regardless, whatever the situation,

136
00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:11.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
there’s no doubt that Shin’s parents
are irresponsible.

137
00:10:11.235 --> 00:10:12.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If they can't raise a child properly,

138
00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:13.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they shouldn’t have given birth to him.

139
00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:16.532 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>No, I haven’t seen her since I was four.</i>

140
00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:19.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>She ran off with a guy.</i>

141
00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:24.081 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are too many mothers in this world
who think giving birth is a joke.

142
00:10:30.671 --> 00:10:33.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t think she thought it was a joke.

143
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:37.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe there was a reason
she couldn't raise him right.

144
00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:41.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe there were circumstances
beyond her control.

145
00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:43.893 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s only natural that an expectant mother

146
00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:46.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
would wanna give birth
and raise her child.

147
00:10:47.229 --> 00:10:48.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why is it only natural?

148
00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:50.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, you see…

149
00:10:54.028 --> 00:10:55.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can’t really explain it.

150
00:10:56.947 --> 00:10:58.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like, maternal instinct?

151
00:11:01.243 --> 00:11:02.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

152
00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:07.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. I’ve been so busy,
I thought I’d come to get them when I can,

153
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.377 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in case I’m not able
to come when I need to.

154
00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then should I write you
a two-month prescription?

155
00:11:17.968 --> 00:11:19.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s the matter?

156
00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:22.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Um, this may be
a strange thing to ask, but…

157
00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:28.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m not so sure what people mean
when they talk about maternal instinct.

158
00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it something every woman normally has?

159
00:11:34.777 --> 00:11:38.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I believe so.
It’s a female instinct after all.

160
00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:45.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, just because all women
have it within them

161
00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:48.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
doesn’t mean all women use it.

162
00:11:48.582 --> 00:11:49.959 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think that applies to anything.

163
00:11:50.793 --> 00:11:52.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I believe it’s something within a woman

164
00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:55.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that is awakened
by the woman’s situation and needs.

165
00:11:56.549 --> 00:12:02.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Then, if for example,</i>
<i>I was expecting Ren’s baby right now,</i>

166
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>would I wanna give birth</i>
<i>even though I’d know</i>

167
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:12.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>it would be nothing but trouble</i>
<i>just before my professional debut?</i>

168
00:12:13.023 --> 00:12:17.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>And not for Ren’s sake,</i>
<i>but due to my instinct?</i>

169
00:12:20.948 --> 00:12:22.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>That’s just not possible.</i>

170
00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:30.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My stomach hurts.

171
00:12:32.543 --> 00:12:37.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why does your stomach hurt
like this every day?

172
00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:39.175 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you hate to practice that much?

173
00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:41.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hate you, Nana!

174
00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:44.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hachi would be a lot kinder to me!

175
00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:48.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wanna see Hachi!
Why won’t she come to the studio?

176
00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:50.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because she doesn’t wanna bother us.

177
00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:51.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This isn’t some playground after all.

178
00:12:51.979 --> 00:12:54.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But Mr. Kawano said it’s okay.

179
00:12:54.815 --> 00:12:56.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He may have said so,

180
00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:57.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but still, you'd normally
feel uncomfortable coming.

181
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s not fair, Nobu,
keeping Hachi all to yourself.

182
00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:03.282 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I haven’t seen her since the day
of the fireworks either!

183
00:13:04.658 --> 00:13:06.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Why?

184
00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:08.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have band practice
until late every night,

185
00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:10.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and we both work during the day.

186
00:13:10.414 --> 00:13:12.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have no time to meet.

187
00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:16.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But she'd come see you
every night until recently.

188
00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:18.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She won’t come even if I ask.

189
00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She’s probably having her period.

190
00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:21.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
CONVINCED

191
00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:26.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You went together with Nana
to see Misato off today, right?

192
00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:28.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You should’ve insisted
on having her come today.

193
00:13:29.016 --> 00:13:31.393 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, she wasn’t looking too well.

194
00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:32.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you mean she wasn’t looking well?

195
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s just summer heat fatigue.

196
00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:36.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess that's what the doctor said, too.
She'll be fine.

197
00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:38.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's bad enough she had to see a doctor?

198
00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bye.

199
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.947 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you wanna become number one,

200
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.282 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
be prepared to not take a break
even to be by your parents’ deathbed.

201
00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:47.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't like this strict band…

202
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, Shin! Where are you going?

203
00:13:49.119 --> 00:13:51.038 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told you, my stomach hurts!

204
00:13:51.121 --> 00:13:53.374 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does he really wanna do this?

205
00:13:53.457 --> 00:13:55.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At least let him go to the bathroom
when he has to.

206
00:13:56.043 --> 00:13:58.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You seriously lack the sense
of kindness to others!

207
00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:02.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you guys lack the sense
to be suspicious of others.

208
00:14:03.634 --> 00:14:05.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or maybe Shin's body reacts funny
