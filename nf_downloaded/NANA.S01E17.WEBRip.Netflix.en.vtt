00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:52.847 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Nana’s name is written
in katakana characters.

104
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn’t she totally pretty?

105
00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:57.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s amazing how different two people
with the same name can be.

106
00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:58.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mom!

107
00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:01.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I pity you, my daughter.

108
00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:02.482 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Way to go, Natsuko!

109
00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:04.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re laughing too much, Nami!

110
00:08:04.358 --> 00:08:07.069 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nami, I found out
you’re talking nonsense again.

111
00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:09.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Apparently, Nana lives with Nana.

112
00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:11.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-What?

113
00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:13.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why? What about your boyfriend?

114
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:14.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Again, you’re misunderstanding!

115
00:08:15.077 --> 00:08:17.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you serious? That’s no fun.

116
00:08:17.413 --> 00:08:20.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then why didn’t you tell us
in the first place?

117
00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:22.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re a source of constant worry.

118
00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:23.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told you,

119
00:08:23.127 --> 00:08:25.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-but you wouldn’t listen, Mom.
-So you’re living with my daughter.

120
00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:29.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can only imagine how much trouble
she’s causing. I’m really sorry.

121
00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:34.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, Nana is honest, cheerful and kind.

122
00:08:34.096 --> 00:08:35.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Living with her encourages me.

123
00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:38.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As I imagined,

124
00:08:38.392 --> 00:08:40.937 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can see she’s been brought up
in a very warm family environment.

125
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You certainly know
the right things to say.

126
00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:44.315 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ouch!
-You still have time, right?

127
00:08:44.398 --> 00:08:45.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why don’t I make some tea?
-Nana…

128
00:08:45.816 --> 00:08:47.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Here are some Japanese sweets…</i>

129
00:08:50.988 --> 00:08:53.991 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Nana, you’re such a good actress.
-Huh?

130
00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:56.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Nana is honest, cheerful and kind?"

131
00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:58.871 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really believe that.

132
00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>She encourages me.</i>

133
00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:06.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By the way, where’s your dad?
Does he work Saturdays too?

134
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, yeah. He’ll be back in the evening.

135
00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:11.467 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then I can meet him.
I’m looking forward to it.

136
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:15.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s not a father worth
getting your hopes up for.

137
00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:17.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or rather, I’m sorry.
My family can be so noisy.

138
00:09:17.765 --> 00:09:18.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m embarrassed.

139
00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:21.477 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I’m really enjoying it.

140
00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:23.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Natsuko’s better than I imagined.

141
00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:24.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Meeting her was such a thrill.

142
00:09:24.355 --> 00:09:27.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What’s so great about her?
She’s just a normal lady.

143
00:09:27.483 --> 00:09:30.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, that’s a quality you don’t see much.

144
00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:31.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She is the ideal mother.

145
00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:34.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really? Then what about your mom, Nana?

146
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What kind of person is she?
I bet she's pretty and cool.

147
00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:41.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder. I can barely remember.

148
00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:43.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you mean?

149
00:09:43.499 --> 00:09:46.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’ve only been away from
your hometown for less than half a year.

150
00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:49.171 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I haven’t seen her since I was four.

151
00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.507 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Why not?

152
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.342 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She ran off with a guy.

153
00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:56.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She could even be dead now.

154
00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not that I care.

155
00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:03.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then, Nana, it was just
you and your father?

156
00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:05.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you have any siblings?

157
00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:07.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

158
00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:11.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, I never had a father
to start with.

159
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was raised by my mother’s mother.

160
00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:17.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But my grandma died when I was 15.

161
00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:21.454 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s why I find this so attractive.

162
00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:24.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The atmosphere of belonging
to a loving family like yours.

163
00:10:24.957 --> 00:10:27.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Since I never had one, this is fun.

164
00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Attractive? But Nana…</i>

165
00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:35.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>To me, this is normal.</i>

166
00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:44.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry… for talking about a gloomy subject.

167
00:10:44.852 --> 00:10:47.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I was just a bit surprised.

168
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.900 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sorry for asking you so many questions
without giving it much thought.

169
00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:53.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I’m glad.

170
00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:58.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, no, that came out wrong! Sorry.
I’m not glad about what happened.

171
00:10:58.407 --> 00:11:00.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That part really shocked me!
-Calm down.

172
00:11:02.953 --> 00:11:08.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nana. You've never talked to me
about yourself until now,

173
00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:10.336 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I would wonder why that is.

174
00:11:10.419 --> 00:11:14.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It made me sad wondering about it.

175
00:11:15.424 --> 00:11:18.594 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I’m glad you shared that with me.

176
00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:22.098 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see. Sorry.

177
00:11:22.723 --> 00:11:26.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It never occurred to me
that you might be feeling like that.

178
00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:32.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I never had a close female friend
until now,

179
00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:36.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I don’t know how
to spend time together.

180
00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:40.574 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m not good at talking about myself.

181
00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:42.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I end up not talking about things.

182
00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:52.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But just ask me, and I’ll tell you
anything you want, okay?

183
00:11:53.587 --> 00:11:54.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So stop feeling sad.

184
00:12:01.303 --> 00:12:02.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s so funny?

185
00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:05.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because Nana, why are you
always acting like a cool guy?

186
00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:09.395 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re more like a boyfriend to me
than a female friend.

187
00:12:09.478 --> 00:12:12.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You just took my breath away right now.

188
00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:14.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I can’t have you
feel that way about me.

189
00:12:16.944 --> 00:12:19.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’ll really tell me anything
I want, right?

190
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yeah.
-And promise to be frank with me.

191
00:12:22.783 --> 00:12:24.076 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

192
00:12:26.495 --> 00:12:27.663 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you still love Ren?

193
00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:37.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You knew.

194
00:12:39.091 --> 00:12:42.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m sorry.
Acting as if I didn’t know. But…

195
00:12:42.803 --> 00:12:46.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

196
00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:48.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

197
00:12:52.563 --> 00:12:53.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana.

198
00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:28.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nana, I wanna buy a poster
and stuff. What about you?

199
00:13:30.726 --> 00:13:33.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll have a smoke and then go to my seat.

200
00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:35.856 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

218
00:15:20.836 --> 00:15:24.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now that we have our band members,
all we need is a band name.

219
00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:25.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What will it be?

220
00:15:26.008 --> 00:15:28.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why don’t we keep the band name
we had before?

221
00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:29.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There’s nothing wrong with Brute.

222
00:15:29.553 --> 00:15:31.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s so lame. Sounds too barbaric.

223
00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:33.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re the one who came up with the name.

224
00:15:34.016 --> 00:15:36.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, but I want to start fresh.

225
00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:39.396 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We finally have a pretty girl on vocals,

226
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.856 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so we can’t have
anything barbaric, can we?

227
00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:42.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

228
00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:47.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then what about Olive? Popeye’s girl.

229
00:15:47.738 --> 00:15:49.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does Olive match your image? I think not.

230
00:15:49.865 --> 00:15:52.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Same goes for you. And me.

231
00:15:52.743 --> 00:15:56.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana, stop laughing and help us think.

232
00:15:58.165 --> 00:16:00.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anything you come up with is fine with me.

233
00:16:00.167 --> 00:16:03.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, are you serious
about being the vocalist of the band?

234
00:16:03.712 --> 00:16:06.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Anything is fine with me.

235
00:16:06.173 --> 00:16:07.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you say you’re enjoying life,

236
00:16:07.883 --> 00:16:09.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the way you take on everything
with that slanted attitude?

237
00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:12.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I never said, "Anything is fine with me."

238
00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:16.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then give it some thought.
Give some input into the band.

239
00:16:16.266 --> 00:16:19.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This coming from the most
self-centered member of the band.

240
00:16:21.271 --> 00:16:24.942 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What about this? This is nice.
"Black Stone".

241
00:16:25.025 --> 00:16:27.611 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t just pick the first thing you see.

242
00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:30.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it’s cool.
I’ve never seen anything like it.

243
00:16:30.864 --> 00:16:33.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are those any good?
They have a strong scent.

244
00:16:34.034 --> 00:16:36.537 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, they’re good.
They’re actually cigars.

245
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I made a trade
with a tobacco shop owner for them.

246
00:16:38.872 --> 00:16:40.374 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-A trade?
-A trade?

247
00:16:40.457 --> 00:16:43.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yuck! What’s this? Such a weird taste!
-Really?

248
00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:48.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But not bad. Black Stone.
BLAST for short. That’s easy to say.

249
00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:50.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, that’s nice. "BLAST".

250
00:16:50.926 --> 00:16:52.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>He took my cigarette.</i>

251
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yuck!
-<i>What the…</i>

252
00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:57.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, BLAST also
means a strong gust of wind.

253
00:16:57.766 --> 00:16:58.642 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

254
00:16:58.726 --> 00:17:01.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s great! That’s kinda cool that
we shorten the name,

255
00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:02.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it also means something!

256
00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:04.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Should we go with that then?

257
00:17:04.314 --> 00:17:07.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We’re a band of four,
so let’s go with "Black Stones".

258
00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:09.778 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s an odd name,
but we’re an odd band, so it kinda fits.

259
00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:11.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Agreed! Hurray for BLAST!

260
00:17:11.488 --> 00:17:12.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, it’s decided.

261
00:17:12.948 --> 00:17:15.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, leader,
how about a celebration speech?

262
00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:16.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>They really went with it.</i>

263
00:17:17.786 --> 00:17:21.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well then, band members,
an order from your leader.

264
00:17:21.999 --> 00:17:25.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
From this day on, we’ll all
smoke this brand of cigarettes.

265
00:17:25.252 --> 00:17:27.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-Smoke them yourself!
-Smoke them yourself!

266
00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:41.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Reira!

267

00:20:34.858 --> 00:20:39.947 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
