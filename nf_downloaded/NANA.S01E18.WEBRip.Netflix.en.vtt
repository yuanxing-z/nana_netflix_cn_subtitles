00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The fans were great today.
They were really into our performance.

-You mean prefectural identity.

Please don’t bother talking
to the audience on stage, Naoki.

21
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It exposes your lack of intelligence.

22
00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:44.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let’s add songs to our encore.

23
00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Two more songs don’t feel like enough.

24
00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:49.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But we haven’t rehearsed.
Don’t be ridiculous.

25
00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:52.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’ll be impossible.
We’re approaching our time limit here.

26
00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:54.419 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We’re not renting
this hall for free, you know.

27
00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:58.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For a manager,
you can be really stingy, Take.

28
00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:02.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Reira, you shouldn’t talk either.

29
00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:10.727 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, Ren, you know
you made a mistake in the second song.

30
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You might’ve thought you got away with it,
but that was pretty obvious…

31
00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:14.731 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where are you going, Ren?

32
00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:15.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To take a piss!

33
00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:21.362 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Where’d he make a mistake?
I didn’t notice anything.

34
00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So even Ren can make a mistake, I guess.

35
00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:27.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

<i>What is it with our band members?</i>

36
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:34.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

37
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:39.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

38
00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:43.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s not likely able to see the audience
with all those spotlights.

39
00:05:43.092 --> 00:05:45.386 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Well, I can’t speak from experience.

40
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

42
00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But we’re sitting in the first row.</i>
<i>Can’t he see a little?</i>

43
00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.102 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Oh, this may be a trap</i>

44
00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.357 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It must feel really good,
singing in such a big place.

45
00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:05.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

46
00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Being you, Nana, I’m sure you will.</i>

47
00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:13.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>The band BLAST will surpass Trapnest!</i>

48
00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:27.386 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-Yasu, Nana’s here!

49
00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:32.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right. Is the concert over already?

50
00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:34.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>It’s not over.</i>
<i>We’re about to go out for the encore.</i>

51
00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:36.938 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Well, good luck with that.</i>

52
00:06:37.021 --> 00:06:39.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You knew about this, didn’t you?
Why didn’t you tell me?

53
00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

54
00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:43.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then you succeeded.
I even made a mistake on stage.

55
00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:45.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although I faked it
with a little rearrangement.

56
00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:48.533 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really? That’s even more than
I could’ve asked for.

57
00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:49.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

58
00:06:50.284 --> 00:06:52.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

59
00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:53.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but what’s she doing
out here in the countryside?

60
00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:55.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not to mention the front row.

61
00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:57.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Then jump off the stage and embrace her.</i>

62
00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:58.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can’t expect me to do that!

63
00:06:59.877 --> 00:07:02.004 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ren! What are you shouting about?

64
00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:03.798 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t lose it yet.
We’re not done with the performance!

65
00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:05.842 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

68
00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:20.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

71
00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

He may have tried to call.

Why would Yasu…

Maybe Yasu gave Ren my number.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:43.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I forgot to turn
the phone back on after the concert.

117

120
00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:51.734 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:10:53.277 --> 00:10:56.947 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Probably. I provoked him a bit.

I don’t know what you told Ren,
but mind your own business.

125
00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:06.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have nothing to say

00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:07.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

127
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:12.171 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was he who called me
after noticing you at the concert hall.

128
00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:16.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

130
00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:21.972 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you have no need for the key
to the place you and Ren used to live

00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:27.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

around Ren’s neck, just get rid of them.

132
00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I can’t sleep, so I’m going
to Takumi’s room to play cards.

148
00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:55.774 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

149
00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:58.611 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

150
00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:02.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

151
00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:03.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:44.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It just gives them an excuse to meet.

210
00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:47.501 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They’re man and woman.
Let that take care of the rest.

211
00:18:47.584 --> 00:18:51.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shin, not that I care,
but you’ve been acting saucy lately.

212
00:18:51.171 --> 00:18:53.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t be so snobbish.

213
00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:54.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, that’s Ron for me!
-Huh?

214
00:18:54.883 --> 00:18:57.553 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did I win?
-He’s good.

215
00:18:57.636 --> 00:19:01.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You tricked me. You are so not cute.

216
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mahjong is so much fun.

217
00:19:03.892 --> 00:19:05.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Next time,
we should play with four people.

218
00:19:05.602 --> 00:19:06.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does Nana play too?

219
00:19:06.895 --> 00:19:09.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. We used to play
a four-person game a lot

220
00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:10.774 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
when Ren was around.

221
00:19:10.858 --> 00:19:13.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Say, let’s ask Ren over next time.

222
00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:16.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really? I can meet Ren? I wanna see him!

223
00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:17.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wanna see him too!

224
00:19:17.906 --> 00:19:22.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why is it you're always
secretly meeting Ren behind my back?

225
00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:24.163 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m always left out.

226
00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:27.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ren doesn’t have the guts to see you.
-Huh?

227
00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:31.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So he feels guilty about leaving BLAST.

228
00:19:32.212 --> 00:19:35.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He initially declined Trapnest’s offer,
you know.

229
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then Takumi gave me a call.

230
00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:42.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was the one who persuaded Ren to join.

231
00:19:42.806 --> 00:19:46.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Still, he feels that he betrayed us.

232
00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:51.190 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s no need for him to fuss
over something that happened in the past.

233
00:19:51.273 --> 00:19:52.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It doesn’t suit him.

234
00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:55.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But that’s Ren for you.

235
00:19:55.611 --> 00:19:56.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can a guy so awkward with people

236
00:19:56.987 --> 00:19:59.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
really make it
in the brutal world of entertainment?

237
00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:01.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It worries me.

238
00:20:02.743 --> 00:20:06.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, in that case,
why don’t I send him an email?

239
00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:09.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-An invitation to a mahjong tournament.
-Yay!

240
00:20:09.249 --> 00:20:11.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He’ll be so happy that he’ll cry.

241
00:20:11.293 --> 00:20:15.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By the way, Yasu,
you said you provoked Ren on the phone.

242
00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:16.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What did you say?

243
00:20:16.548 --> 00:20:20.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What tactics did you use?
Tell me so I can learn for myself.

244
00:20:20.427 --> 00:20:23.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t really have any tactics.

245
00:20:23.096 --> 00:20:24.932 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can’t you tell the level of my stupidity?

246
00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:28.393 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you’re really smart! Unlike Nobu.

247
00:20:28.477 --> 00:20:30.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s not about how smart I am.

248
00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:34.524 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You still have a lot to learn.

249
00:20:42.699 --> 00:20:47.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Back then, I thought</i>
<i>I’d never wanna fall in love again.</i>

250
00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:54.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>But that night, I wanted to dream again.</i>

251
00:20:54.711 --> 00:20:56.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I wanted to love someone</i>
<i>from the bottom of my heart,</i>

252
00:20:57.756 --> 00:21:00.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>no matter how I may get hurt,</i>
<i>no matter how I may suffer.</i>

253
00:21:01.176 --> 00:21:07.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>That’s what I felt that night</i>
<i>while praying for your happiness, Nana.</i>
