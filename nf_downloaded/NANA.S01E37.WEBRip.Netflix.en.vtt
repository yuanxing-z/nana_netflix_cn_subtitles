5
00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:55.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? She moved?

6
00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.909 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mm-hmm. She says she lives
a lot farther away,

7
00:01:57.992 --> 00:01:59.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so she doesn’t think she can come by much.

8
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:01.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She asked me to give her best
to everyone here at Jackson’s.

9
00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:03.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait a minute.
What’s that supposed to mean?

10
00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:04.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s making me feel really lonely.

11
00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:06.626 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who moved?

12
00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana. She moved to Shirogane.

13
00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:11.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why Shirogane, all of a sudden?

14
00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:14.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Minami Aoyama, Hiroo, Azabu.

15
00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:17.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Each one of those properties
were spectacular as well.

16
00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:18.888 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They’re all in really expensive districts!

17
00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:23.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I thought right from the beginning
that Nana would choose Shirogane.

18
00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:24.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why’s that?

19
00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:26.980 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because it’s the place that
young wives dream about.

20
00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:28.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Young wives?

21
00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:32.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She probably wants to be one
of the "Housewives of Shirogane."

22
00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:34.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What the…

23
00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:37.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Personally, I’m a bit relieved.

24
00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:39.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m looking forward to seeing Nana
in a wedding dress.

25
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even if she’s doing it
for her child’s sake,

26
00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:44.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can’t understand how she could marry
a guy she doesn’t even love.

27
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, if she didn’t love him,
she wouldn’t do it.

28
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But what about Nobu?
-She probably loves them both.

29
00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:54.591 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s something
you can relate to, isn’t it?

30
00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:55.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m home!

31
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? You’re here, Shoji.

32
00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:01.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you’ve finally run out of money
to drink at Jackson’s?

33
00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:03.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A toast to Nana,
who’s marrying a rich guy.

34
00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:04.767 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you heard.

35
00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:07.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although she probably wouldn’t want you
to celebrate it.

36
00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:13.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But how rich is this guy,
who can afford a million-yen rent?

37
00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:15.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it’s 700,000 yen.

38
00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:21.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She persuaded him to save some
of the rent money for the child.

39
00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:23.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana’s starting to mature.

40
00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:25.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s the strength of becoming
a mother, I guess.

41
00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:27.582 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But even 700,000 yen is plenty expensive!

42
00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:30.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Who is this guy?
-He’s a musician.

43
00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Someone close to that guru again?

44
00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:38.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess. He’s Yasu’s friend, I hear.

45
00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:41.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it’s one of Yasu’s friends,
there’s no need to worry.

46
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:44.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But for him to have that much income
would mean, unlike BLAST,

47
00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:46.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
this guy’s a professional musician, right?

48
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:47.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is he famous?

49
00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:51.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, one would have to be a major star
to make that much in music.

50
00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:54.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s likely some carefree son
of a rich family.

51
00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:58.905 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides, why would a famous star
want to marry someone like Nana?

52
00:03:58.988 --> 00:04:01.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Also, with how excited Nana gets
when it comes to celebrities,

53
00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
there’s no way she would’ve kept quiet
about it if he were even a little famous.

54
00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But maybe she’s forced to keep it
a secret because he’s a celebrity!

55
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:08.873 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

56
00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:10.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What’s his name?
-Takumi.

57
00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:13.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Takumi is so cool!

58
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of Trapnest?

59
00:04:16.714 --> 00:04:19.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s impossible! Are you dumb?

60
00:04:24.138 --> 00:04:28.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why are you following me?
-See ya.

61
00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:30.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why not? I’ll leave right away!

62
00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:33.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Just let me get a glimpse of Hachiko!
-All right.

63
00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:37.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Welcome home.

64
00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:39.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This place is nice. Is it a new building?

65
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The rent is very reasonable
for the space, right?

66
00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's because you have to walk
a bit from the train station.

67
00:04:44.158 --> 00:04:45.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You never use the train anyway.

68
00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.537 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is nice. Like a hidden residence.

69
00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:52.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it your first time to this place, too?

70
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because we were confined
to the studio the whole time?

71
00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:57.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. I came to see this place once
when I signed the contract.

72
00:04:57.338 --> 00:04:58.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

73
00:04:58.464 --> 00:05:02.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I needed to check the neighborhood
and the security system,

74
00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:04.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or else I’d be worried.

75
00:05:04.178 --> 00:05:05.555 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Hello?</i>

76
00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m home.

77
00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Ah, um… Welcome home!</i>

78
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She’s tripping on her words.
She’s too cute.

79
00:05:13.062 --> 00:05:16.024 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You seem to be having fun, Takumi.
-Because we’re newlyweds.

80
00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:18.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you’re not legally married yet.

81
00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you really serious
about getting married?

82
00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:22.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re still renting the place
in Akasaka too, right?

83
00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:23.489 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you planning to live separately?

84
00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:26.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shut up. I’ll move out of
that place eventually.

85
00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:27.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Eventually?

86
00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:35.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s an auto-lock on each floor too.
Talk about high security.

87
00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:41.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m seldom at home, so this is
to ensure the safety of my wife and child.

88
00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:44.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Especially since you have
many extreme fans.

89
00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:48.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why are they so fixated
on chasing an illusion?

90
00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:50.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I have trouble understanding it.
-It’s because it’s an illusion!

91
00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:57.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In reality, there is no person
who would do exactly as you’d wish.

92
00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:03.029 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Takumi, you are getting married
to a woman whom

93
00:06:03.112 --> 00:06:04.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you have trouble understanding, right?

94
00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:06.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have trouble understanding that.

95
00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:12.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nana knows that reality and illusions
are two different things.

96
00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:15.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She knows that, and she still dreams
without getting discouraged.

97
00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:16.626 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s what’s so cute about her.

98
00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:19.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then Hachiko and I are the same!

99
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.881 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So that makes me cute, too! Right, Takumi?

100
00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:23.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I wanna smack him.</i>

101
00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-<i>Yes?</i>
-I’m home.

102
00:06:27.845 --> 00:06:29.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What am I gonna do?

103
00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:31.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m getting nervous.

104
00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please don’t stay long.

105
00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:35.269 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t intrude on our first night
as newlyweds.

106
00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you’re not newlyweds,
and it’s not your first night together.

107
00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:43.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Welcome home!
-Hi. Good evening.

108
00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.362 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

109
00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:49.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good evening…

110
00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:50.243 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
NAOKI

111
00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:51.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Hachiko’s so cute!

112
00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:53.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
If you’re satisfied, go home.

113
00:06:58.042 --> 00:06:59.669 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This place is like a castle!

114
00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:01.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>What part?</i>

115
00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:05.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You must be exhausted from your recording.

116
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How thoughtful of you.

117
00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it’s not inconvenient,
won’t you stay for dinner?

118
00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:11.556 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes!
-Don’t bother.

119
00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He’ll be leaving right away.

120
00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:17.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I’ll have dinner ready right away.

121
00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:19.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I got carried away and prepared too much,

122
00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:21.524 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so it would be a great help
if you’d eat with us.

123
00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:24.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

124
00:07:24.193 --> 00:07:25.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
MORNING SICKNESS COUNTERMEASURE

125
00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:35.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow! Thanks for the food!

126
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Delicious!

127
00:07:36.747 --> 00:07:38.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah? I’m glad.

128
00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:40.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re a great cook, just like I’d heard.

129
00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:43.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No wonder he’d want you as his wife.

130
00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:46.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s not why I decided to marry her.

131
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If that’s what I wanted,
a housekeeper would have been fine.

132
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:53.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But there aren’t many girls
who can cook like this.

133
00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:55.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On top of that,
it must’ve been a lot of work

134
00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:58.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to make this place so livable
so soon after moving.

135
00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:03.524 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, I had a professional coordinator
do the interior design before I moved in.

136
00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:06.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I found it difficult to express
the image I had in mind,

137
00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:08.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so it ended up looking a bit over the top.

138
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:09.489 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see.

139
00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:12.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can gradually change things as we like.

140
00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:13.993 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Speaking of which,

141
00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:15.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
what about the furniture
you were using at your last place?

142
00:08:15.953 --> 00:08:20.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did you throw them away?
-No. I put them all in a room for now.

143
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Your private room?
-No, I plan to make that the baby’s room.

144
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can use a lot of my furniture as is.

145
00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:30.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I even had the wallpaper changed,
and the room looks so cute now!

146
00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:32.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I wanna see it!
-Take a look!

147
00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So cute!
-Isn’t it?

148
00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:38.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you, Mama!

149
00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:39.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A flower pattern?

150
00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:42.021 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s nothing wrong with that.
It looks really cute.

151
00:08:42.104 --> 00:08:43.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like a princess’ room.

152
00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What if it’s a boy?

153
00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:51.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What’ll we do?
I felt so sure that it’s gonna be a girl.

154
00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:54.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I’m sure it will be a girl.

155
00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:56.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t understand how
you could be so sure.

156
00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:59.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry. I got carried away.

157
00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:03.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t worry.
Wallpaper can be changed anytime.

158
00:09:03.834 --> 00:09:06.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we can keep trying
until we have a girl.

159
00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Geez…

160
00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:14.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well then… I guess I’ll be going now.

161
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just ask at the front desk,
and they’ll call you a taxi.

162
00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:20.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Thanks for having me over.

163
00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And thanks for the great meal, Nana.

164
00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please come again anytime, okay?

165
00:09:24.313 --> 00:09:26.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll come when Takumi’s not around.

166
00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:28.985 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way! That would be a problem!

167
00:09:30.444 --> 00:09:34.740 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Naoki’s really funny.
I never imagined him to be so outgoing.

168
00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:36.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think we could get along.
That makes me happy.

169
00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:40.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really? He made me super exhausted.
Fill up the tub for me, will you?

170
00:09:40.871 --> 00:09:42.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I did that already.

171
00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:48.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don’t need to try
and be the perfect wife.

172
00:09:48.212 --> 00:09:50.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let’s take a bath together and relax.

173
00:09:50.506 --> 00:09:52.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I can’t relax doing that.</i>

174
00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:56.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you lose weight?

175
00:09:58.514 --> 00:10:00.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm-hmm. About three kilos.

176
00:10:00.516 --> 00:10:02.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is your morning sickness that bad?

177
00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:06.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I’ve been feeling a lot better
these past two, three days,

178
00:10:06.397 --> 00:10:08.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
perhaps because of the change
in atmosphere after moving.

179
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:12.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides, I was getting a bit chubby,
so it’s perfect now.

180
00:10:12.194 --> 00:10:13.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess so.

181
00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:18.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m sure you’ll get chubby again
once the morning sickness is over.

182
00:10:18.534 --> 00:10:21.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No way!
-I’ll bet you’ll become really fat.

183
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:24.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What’ll I do?
In fact, I tend to gain weight easily!

184
00:10:25.082 --> 00:10:26.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My mom and older sister are both chubby,

185
00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:30.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and my younger sister goes through
great effort to maintain her great figure.

186
00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:33.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-How many siblings do you have?
-Two!

187
00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Both girls?
-Mm-hmm!

188
00:10:35.926 --> 00:10:39.555 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Wow, that’s kind of scary.
-There’s nothing scary about it.

189
00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:42.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My older sister is
as kind as a bodhisattva.

190
00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:43.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you talk to your parents?

191
00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:48.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. I called my mom.

192
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How much did you tell her?

193
00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:58.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That I’m pregnant, so I might get married.

194
00:10:59.867 --> 00:11:03.412 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What do you mean "might"?
Can’t you trust me?

195
00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:06.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-But…
-Oh well.

196
00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:08.584 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And what did Mommy say?

197
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:11.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mommy? M-- Mommy said…

198
00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:15.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, really? Congratulations. You did well.

199
00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:19.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Like that.
-What kind of mom is that?

200
00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:21.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She’s that kind of mom.

201
00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:24.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I’ll bet your dad
is furious, isn’t he?

202
00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:25.559 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not really.

203
00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:28.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right after that call, he called me.

204
00:11:28.562 --> 00:11:29.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Rather than be angry,

205
00:11:29.605 --> 00:11:33.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he just sighed and went on
about what a foolish daughter I am.

206
00:11:33.317 --> 00:11:35.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He asked me what kind of man you are,

207
00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:39.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I told him that you work
in the music industry.

208
00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:42.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He works at a karaoke joint?
Is it all-you-can-sing?

209
00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:44.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s what he said.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I summed it up and told him
that you write music and stuff.

211
00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:50.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

212
00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:52.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because if they found out
it’s Takumi of Trapnest,

213
00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:57.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

214
00:11:57.258 --> 00:12:00.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I haven’t even told
Jun-chan about this yet.

215
00:12:00.177 --> 00:12:01.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:04.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:12:05.015 --> 00:12:08.102 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:12:08.185 --> 00:12:10.396 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:13.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s no need to be secretive about this
to the people close to you.

220
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:20.656 --> 00:12:23.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rather than trying to hide it,
it’s better to inform them

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:26.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

it because I’m marrying an ordinary girl.

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:31.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I’ll be coming to meet them.

226
00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:36.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

227
00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:39.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
