00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:25.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

10
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. But before that,
she was Nobu’s classmate, and…

11
00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:29.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

13
00:02:32.443 --> 00:02:34.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

decide to go pro, Yasu.

15
00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

16
00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:43.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I’m not so confident
we’ll make it that big, but…

17
00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:44.539 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

18
00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:46.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

a great solo artist.

19

20
00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:54.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Reira? A new scandal uncovered?

21
00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe it's a neighbor complaining
about the noise.

22
00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:59.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

37
00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:54.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

83
00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:31.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

84
00:08:31.135 --> 00:08:32.929 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he seems to be pretty manly

85
00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:34.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

86
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

87
00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:38.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To me, he just sounds like some

88
00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

89
00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:42.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He used Nana’s cell phone
to call Nobu out of the blue

90
00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:43.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and tell him about this.

91
00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:46.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s natural for Nobu to be
overly suspicious of Nana and pull back.

92
00:08:46.984 --> 00:08:48.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s trying to take away
Nobu’s will to fight for Nana

93
00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:50.571 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

94
00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:53.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On top of that, he locked himself
in Nana’s room, so she couldn’t interfere.

95
00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:58.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If he was really thinking of Nana,
he wouldn’t have taken such actions.

96
00:08:58.287 --> 00:08:59.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He’s the type of person who would

97
00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:02.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
manipulate others
without thinking twice about it.

98
00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:05.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If he really planned all that
on the spur of the moment,

99
00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:08.798 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he’s an extremely clever guy.

100
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:10.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In a way, I’m impressed.

101
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm pretty sure Takumi didn't give it
that much thought.

102
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s because I told him that
Nobu’s my boyfriend,

103
00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:21.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so he simply did it out of jealousy.

104
00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:23.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, isn't that nice.

00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:26.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's just that he has a lot of pride.

106
00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:28.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You call that pride?
-Huh?

107
00:09:28.859 --> 00:09:30.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If those are his true feelings,

108
00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then he’s as immature as a kid
whose toy’s been taken away.

109
00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-You may be right.
-Really?

110
00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:41.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh well, in any case,
he’s gotta be pretty serious about this

111
00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:43.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to say he’ll be the child’s guardian.

112
00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:47.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If he was a classmate of Yasu,
then that would make him 23 or 24, right?

113
00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:51.048 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is he financially sound? What does he do?

114
00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:54.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He’s a musician.

115
00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:57.054 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is that not a concern?
Does he make any money?

116
00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:00.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you keeping quiet?

117
00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:04.061 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, if he said he’ll be the guardian
without hesitation,

118
00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:05.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he’s gotta be somewhat financially sound.

119
00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:09.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I actually don’t like the way
he used the word "guardian."

120
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s almost like saying,
"I’ll pay child support."

121
00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:13.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I think that’s what he meant.

122
00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:14.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

123
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.243 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What the hell? Why won’t he marry you?

124
00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:21.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Does he have a wife and kids?
Is this another extramarital affair?

125
00:10:21.662 --> 00:10:25.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. But getting married would be
a great burden to him.

126
00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:27.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I couldn’t impose on him like that.

127
00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t get you! Are you okay with that?

128
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s good enough for me.

129
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you wanna have this baby that much?

130
00:10:41.932 --> 00:10:46.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At first, I hoped that it was
just my imagination.

131
00:10:46.854 --> 00:10:49.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was escaping from myself,
trying not to think about it.

132
00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:53.069 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But there were signs,
so I became more and more anxious.

133
00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:57.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So when the test showed positive,

134
00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it scared me because it was like
I no longer had anywhere to escape.

135
00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:05.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought, if I really am pregnant,
I should get an abortion right away.

136
00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:09.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I could keep the abortion a secret
from everyone

137
00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:14.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and continue on with my life…
as if nothing had happened.

138
00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:18.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But then at the hospital,

139
00:11:18.886 --> 00:11:21.972 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I realized that there was, in fact,
a child living inside me.

140
00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:24.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was like reality suddenly struck me.

141
00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:25.017 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY

142
00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:26.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I thought to myself that</i>

143
00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:29.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I would never wanna have an abortion</i>
<i>and pretend nothing happened.</i>

144
00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I no longer had a sense</i>
<i>of fear or anxiety.</i>

145
00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:36.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>All I could think about then was</i>
<i>that I had to pull myself together.</i>

146
00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:42.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I don’t know how to say it, but…</i>

147
00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:45.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>like, I felt that I’m the only one</i>

148
00:11:45.996 --> 00:11:48.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>who can protect the life</i>
<i>of the child inside me.</i>

149
00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:51.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I thought about the possibility</i>
<i>of giving birth</i>

150
00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:54.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>and raising the child on my own.</i>

151
00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:58.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>But I don’t have any money.</i>

152
00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:01.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>In addition, I can’t work because</i>
<i>my morning sickness is so bad.</i>

153
00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:04.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I was at a complete loss,</i>

154
00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:06.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>thinking that there’s no way</i>
<i>I’m gonna make it.</i>

155
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:09.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So when Takumi said what he did to me,

156
00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:12.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it surprised me,
but it made me really happy.

157
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:15.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe I shouldn’t be relying on him, but…

158
00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:19.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, there’s nothing wrong with that.
It’s most likely his child, right?

159
00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:22.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nobu was using protection
at all times, right?

160
00:12:22.658 --> 00:12:23.909 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So the chances of the child
being his are low.

161
00:12:25.035 --> 00:12:26.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s a horrible situation, isn’t it?

162
00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:31.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobu always used protection.

163
00:12:32.209 --> 00:12:35.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>And he treated me like I was so precious.</i>

164
00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:40.968 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I'm trampling all over that
and running to Takumi to have the baby.

165
00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:44.972 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can someone so selfish be forgiven?

166
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:51.228 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, Nobu may never forgive you.

167
00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:52.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Given the circumstances,
it appears that he believes

168
00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:54.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you were dating them both
at the same time.

169
00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:59.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I think she needs to resolve
this misunderstanding.

170
00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.406 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But how? There’s no proof.

171
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think he'll believe
her explanations.

172
00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:08.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What I’m saying is,
from Nobu’s perspective,

173
00:13:08.704 --> 00:13:14.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he probably wanted Nana to explain things
just to show that she cares.

174
00:13:14.793 --> 00:13:16.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That could even light a flame
to his fighting spirit,

175
00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:18.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and he’ll say,
"I’ll take care of everything."

176
00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For Nobu’s sake, he may be better off
not having such a flame lit.

177
00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:25.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because you can’t raise a kid
on love alone.

178
00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:28.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’d no longer be in a position
to dream about his band succeeding.

179
00:13:29.016 --> 00:13:33.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He might have to give up his dream
and take over his family inn.

180
00:13:34.813 --> 00:13:38.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I’ll do everything I can</i>

181
00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:43.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>It's one thing if the child were his</i>

182
00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:45.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>He's only twenty, right?</i>

183
00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:48.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>It would be too cruel to have</i>

184
00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:53.374 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And that’s why you felt it’s not right
to rely on Nobu, right, Nana?

185
00:13:53.457 --> 00:13:55.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess it’s not something
you could say to him.

186
00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:59.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nana, you really are seriously
in love with Nobu.

187
00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:04.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She's Nobu's girlfriend,
but she's also a follower of BLAST.

188
00:14:05.094 --> 00:14:09.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Life doesn’t always go
as planned, does it?

190
00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:16.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe there really is a Demon Lord.

191
00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:18.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:21.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s Nana’s fault

00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:24.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

after without any decent break in between!

194
00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:25.948 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your tendency to get carried away

195
00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:26.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

198
00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:34.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:38.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you understand that
you can't have a normal happy family

200
00:14:38.961 --> 00:14:41.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

202
00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:48.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then you’d better be faithful

203
00:14:50.347 --> 00:14:54.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:02.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:04.945 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you won't have a problem raising

becomes the child’s guardian,

208
00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:10.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
whether he’ll love the child or not
is a different issue.

209
00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:13.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know.

210
00:15:16.957 --> 00:15:21.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. If you wanna have it that bad,
I won’t stop you.

211
00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:23.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As long as you never forget
that determination you have.

212
00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

213
00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:27.593 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now that you’ve made that commitment,

214
00:15:27.676 --> 00:15:29.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t wanna ever see you crying again.

215
00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:33.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I pity a child who has to put up
with such a gloomy mother.

216
00:15:33.515 --> 00:15:35.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Try to be like your own mother.

217
00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:50.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m really grateful for everything,
Jun-chan, Kyosuke.

218
00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:52.368 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel much better now that I had
you hear what I had to say.

219
00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:53.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll be in touch.

220
00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:56.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At the least, take good care of your body.

221
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Stay well.
-Mm-hmm.

222
00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:08.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder if she really plans to have it.

223
00:16:09.677 --> 00:16:11.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It not only affects the rest
of Nana’s life

224
00:16:11.387 --> 00:16:13.764 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but the child's life too.

225
00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:15.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m so worried I’m getting a stomachache.

226
00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:18.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>But Nana came to that decision herself,</i>

227
00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:23.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so we really don’t have the right
to interfere with that decision.

228
00:16:23.148 --> 00:16:25.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The best we can do now is support her.

229
00:16:25.275 --> 00:16:27.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess you’re right.

230
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:30.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nana’s dream was to become
a normal housewife.

231
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:35.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>If she had an abortion and things</i>
<i>went well with Nobu,</i>

232
00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:38.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>her dream might have come true</i>
<i>in the near future.</i>

233
00:16:39.623 --> 00:16:42.584 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But she’s sacrificing that</i>
<i>to have this baby.</i>

234
00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:44.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>She must be really determined.</i>

235
00:16:46.296 --> 00:16:50.342 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But as her pa, I would’ve loved
to see Nana in a wedding dress.

236
00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:52.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pa, you say?

237
00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:55.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why won’t Takumi take Nana as his wife?

238
00:16:55.305 --> 00:16:58.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Probably because Nana’s harder
to take care of than the child.

239
00:16:58.809 --> 00:17:00.269 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see.

240
00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:03.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Where are my keys…

241
00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:18.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana!

242
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oops, I fell asleep.

243
00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:25.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Welcome home.

244
00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:31.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Where did you go leaving
the door unlocked?

245
00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:33.469 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was worried.

246
00:17:34.344 --> 00:17:36.972 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did you talk things over with Nobu?
-Ah, yes.

247
00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:40.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry. I thought you had gone home.

248
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:44.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I went shopping.
Want some grapefruit juice?

249
00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:47.274 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Damn! I should’ve put it in the fridge.

250
00:17:52.946 --> 00:17:55.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yasu, do you mind if I have one?

251
00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:57.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go ahead.

252
00:17:57.242 --> 00:17:59.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Smoking’s so tough to quit.

253
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s unlike me to try
and be stoic about it.

254
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s stressing me out in other areas.

255
00:18:04.124 --> 00:18:08.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s right. There’s not much meaning
for you to quit smoking,

256
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so don’t force yourself.

257
00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:10.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Isn’t it more proper for you
to tell me to quit

258
00:18:11.006 --> 00:18:11.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because it’s bad for my health?

259
00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:15.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can’t tell someone to do anything
I can’t do myself.

260
00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:24.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Does it taste good?
-It’s terrible.

261
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:30.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I should be heading back.
The first train will be running shortly.

262
00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:31.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

263
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry for intruding when Naoki was here.

264
00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:35.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Are you dating him?
-No.

265
00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:39.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Somehow, I think he got the wrong idea,
but tell him I said hi.

266
00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:42.412 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you all right, Nana?

267
00:18:42.496 --> 00:18:44.039 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? What about?

268
00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:49.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You idiot! I’m not that broken.

269
00:18:51.213 --> 00:18:53.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t worry. I’ll be fine.

270
00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:56.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t really know
what a normal friendship is, but…

271
00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:00.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No matter what Hachi decides to do,

272
00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:03.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I won't get in the way,
and I'll gently watch over her.

273
00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:06.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Exactly like you’re doing with me.

274
00:19:08.272 --> 00:19:11.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s not as easy as it sounds.

275
00:19:15.362 --> 00:19:18.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I’m sorry, Yasu. Thank you.</i>

276
00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:21.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Don’t worry. Everything will be fine…</i>

277
00:19:21.785 --> 00:19:25.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>because Hachi and I are both women.</i>

278
00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:30.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>But maybe that's why it's so difficult.</i>

279
00:19:31.211 --> 00:19:33.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I begin recording today.

280
00:19:33.463 --> 00:19:34.590 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry.

281
00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:37.176 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it’s okay. We start in the afternoon.

282
00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:39.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But we’ll be confined
to the studio for at least a week.

283
00:19:41.305 --> 00:19:44.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So before I go, could you
let me know what you decided?

284
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As things are, I’d feel so restless

285
00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:49.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wouldn’t be able to keep
my mind on work.

286
00:19:49.938 --> 00:19:51.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry for being so pushy.

287
00:19:57.196 --> 00:20:01.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wanna have this child and raise it
as your child, Takumi…

288
00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:03.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

289
00:20:09.917 --> 00:20:12.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-Huh?

290
00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:16.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don’t wanna raise it
as an illegitimate child, do you?

291
00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:19.593 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If the public finds out,
it'll look bad no matter how we spin it.

292
00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:23.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

there shouldn't be a problem.

00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:28.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides, if I marry an ordinary girl,
the media won’t go too crazy over this.
