52
00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:03.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

58
00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.817 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Regardless, I won’t allow it!

59
00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

60
00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:24.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I’ll just have to skip work.

61
00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:26.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

63
00:05:28.786 --> 00:05:31.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

64
00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:33.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but at least I valued you

65
00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:34.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

66
00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:36.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:42.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

70
00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:50.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

really important.

71

72
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

<i>You’re now fourteen weeks along.</i>

103
00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>The baby is growing well.</i>

104
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ve got a pretty good idea
ò the gender of the baby.

105
00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:19.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

106
00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.942 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would you like to know now?

107
00:07:23.025 --> 00:07:26.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or would you like to keep it a surprise
for when the baby’s born?

108
00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:30.533 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do want to know,

109
00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:32.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but perhaps it would be
more exciting to wait?

110
00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:34.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What should I do…

111
00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:37.582 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s still an educated guess
at this point.

112
00:07:37.665 --> 00:07:38.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

113
00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:42.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s good that your morning sickness
subsided fairly quickly,

114
00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:45.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I am concerned
about your rapid weight gain.

115
00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:48.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you gain too much,
it can be dangerous in many ways,

116
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:52.263 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so try to focus on eating proper portions
of nutritionally balanced foods, okay?

117
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Actually, appearance wise,</i>

118
00:07:56.392 --> 00:07:58.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I don’t wanna gain weight either.</i>

119
00:07:58.644 --> 00:07:59.937 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I ate too much at lunch.</i>

120
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.190 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I’ll avoid the food stands</i>
<i>at the fireworks festival.</i>

121
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did you say something, Sachiko?
Huh? You want a Jackson Burger?

122
00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:14.410 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, no. I have a bad feeling
about that place.

123
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.539 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Maybe I shouldn’t go
to the fireworks festival after all.

124
00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:21.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I’m sure it’ll be really crowded,

125
00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:23.711 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so your chances of seeing her are minimal.

126
00:08:23.794 --> 00:08:25.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But what if I run into her?

127
00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:28.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Myself aside, I’d feel bad for Sachiko.

128
00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:31.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Her evening of fun would be ruined.

129
00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:35.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it’d be worse not to take her
for those reasons.

130
00:08:35.973 --> 00:08:37.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s why I’m in a bind!

131
00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.102 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Damn you, Junko!
-Welcome!

132
00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:43.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s been so long, Koichi Sato!

133
00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:46.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana…

134
00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:50.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My bad feelings have come true.
I’ve been led here by the Demon Lord.

135
00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:52.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you had a revelation, then don’t come!

136
00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But Sachiko said she was hungry.

137
00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:58.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A Jackson Burger and fresh orange juice.

138
00:08:58.412 --> 00:09:00.081 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure.

139
00:09:00.164 --> 00:09:00.998 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sachiko?

140
00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:03.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The baby in my tummy. Four months now.

141
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why’d you name it that?

142
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You’re scaring me!
-Don’t ask me!

143
00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:08.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn’t wanna name her that either!

144
00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:09.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then don’t!

145
00:09:10.424 --> 00:09:13.386 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But my husband has
his heart set on Sachiko.

146
00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:16.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
By "husband," you mean Takumi of Trapnest?

147
00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Jun-chan, you blabbermouth!
-So it is!

148
00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

149
00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:24.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it’s okay. I won’t tell anyone.

150
00:09:24.438 --> 00:09:25.856 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I swear to the Demon Lord himself.

151
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure, I promise. I promise, so…

152
00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Can I get Reira’s autograph?
-You were a fan?

153
00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:34.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought I’d display it
in the alcove at my parents’ place

154
00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:36.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and make it an heirloom.

155
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m sure my grandma would appreciate it
and put her hands together every day.

156
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I guess so then.

157
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll ask for you, but Reira’s really busy,
so I can’t promise anything.

158
00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:45.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re friends with her?

159
00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:47.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, sort of.

160
00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:50.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s amazing, Nana!

161
00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:54.176 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Until recently,
you were just a country girl.

162
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m gonna call you
a celebrity from now on.

163
00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:01.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Stop it. I’m just
your average pregnant woman.

164
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, now you’ve got some attitude.

165
00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:05.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But seeing you now,

166
00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:08.357 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess running around doing
as you wish is a great skill in a way.

167
00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:10.901 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These days, being firm and modest

168
00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:13.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
isn’t enough to get you
on the winning team.

169
00:10:13.237 --> 00:10:16.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ve learned something new.
Congratulations, celebrity!

170
00:10:16.198 --> 00:10:17.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Keep climbing that social ladder!

171
00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:21.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, Take.

172
00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:25.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It looks like Ren’s decided to marry Nana.

173
00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:26.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Marry her?

174
00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:28.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you persuaded him, Takumi?

175
00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:31.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, he brought up the subject himself.

176
00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:34.175 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And he doesn’t seem to have
any ulterior motives.

177
00:10:34.258 --> 00:10:35.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s good.

178
00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:37.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What are you talking about?
-That’s the best.

179
00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:39.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He’s out buying the ring right now.

180
00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:42.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We should arrange for him to meet her,
so he can give it to her.

181
00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:43.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re right.

182
00:10:43.851 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With that ring, I’m sure
even Nana will accept it with joy.

183
00:10:48.397 --> 00:10:50.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We don’t have to worry anymore.

184
00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:55.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, that’s a really big diamond.

185
00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:58.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A worthless guy like me could never afford
to buy something like that in my lifetime.

186
00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:01.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m happy for you, celebrity,
that you didn’t settle with me.

187
00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:04.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
You make it sound
like I’m some evil woman who dumped you.

188
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
But it’s true!
You had me running in circles for you,

189
00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:08.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
and then in the end,
it’s, "I don’t want him!"

190
00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:11.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-Was I your toy?
-You’re the one who cheated on me!

191
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:12.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry.

192
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you think that apologizing now
will make it all right?

193
00:11:15.466 --> 00:11:17.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry, but it’s in the past, isn’t it?

194
00:11:17.718 --> 00:11:19.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m surprised you can be
so casual about it!

195
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m just trying to say what
you wanna hear.

196
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You kept saying how much you loved me,
but it turned out that was all a lie!

197
00:11:26.143 --> 00:11:28.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t remember ever
actually saying that to you.

198
00:11:28.979 --> 00:11:30.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I could hear it!

199
00:11:30.439 --> 00:11:32.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know! And there’s no way that was a lie!

200
00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:36.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know very well
that I’m terrible at lying.

201
00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:37.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s why when I cheated on you,
you found out right away,

202
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.572 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I confessed.

203
00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:47.206 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right away? While we’re at it,
tell me everything.

204
00:11:47.289 --> 00:11:49.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why did you cheat on me?

205
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just gave in to temptation.
Maybe it was the Demon Lord.

206
00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:55.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you were dating them both
for a good two weeks.

207
00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:58.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, Master! If you’re keeping track
of your customers’ criminal records,

208
00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:00.553 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you’ll get taken out someday.

209
00:12:00.636 --> 00:12:01.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Two weeks…

210
00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:05.766 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s all? What a boring man.

211
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:06.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Celebrity!

212
00:12:17.778 --> 00:12:19.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’ve changed my opinion of you.

213
00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.991 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were keeping
Ren’s best interests in mind.

214
00:12:22.074 --> 00:12:22.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

215
00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:26.620 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why, of course. I think
about his interests far more than you do.

216
00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:30.207 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I seriously worry about him, too!

217
00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:34.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if he marries Nana
and she stays with him forever,

218
00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:36.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it’ll cure his bad habits.

219
00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:39.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, that’s what you’re talking about.
-Huh?

220
00:12:39.717 --> 00:12:40.593 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s okay.

221
00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:46.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He can quit whenever he wants to.
Ren just has no desire to.

222
00:12:46.932 --> 00:12:47.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think so?

223
00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:51.228 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think Ren wants to quit if he can.

224
00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:52.980 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then he should quit.

225
00:12:54.064 --> 00:12:57.568 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But even you said you’d quit smoking
for the baby’s sake,

226
00:12:57.651 --> 00:12:59.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
yet you haven’t been able to!

227
00:12:59.403 --> 00:13:02.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nicotine creates a chemical dependency
in your body,

228
00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:04.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so quitting is not that easy.

229
00:13:04.366 --> 00:13:07.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Ren’s psychological dependency
is also an addiction!

230
00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Keep your voice down.

231
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.374 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If word gets out about him,
the band’s activities will be suspended.

232
00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m concerned about it too.
Don’t get so worked up about it.

233
00:13:15.586 --> 00:13:18.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Be concerned for the sake of Ren,
not for that of the band.

234
00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:20.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s not my role.

235
00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:25.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is that why you’re letting him
get married?

236
00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:28.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s a burden to you,
so you want Nana to take on that role?

237
00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:32.228 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s not it. That’s a different story.

238
00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:34.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes?

239
00:13:35.606 --> 00:13:37.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, Mr. Narita.

240
00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:38.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good afternoon.

241
00:13:38.192 --> 00:13:39.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
MITSURU NARITA (46) PRESIDENT

242
00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:41.529 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
How does it look? I dyed it blonde.

243
00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:43.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
At your age? That’s ridiculous!

244
00:13:43.447 --> 00:13:45.282 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Reira, even if he does look ridiculous,

245
00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
that’s no way to talk to the president!

246
00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:49.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What brings you here today?

247
00:13:49.453 --> 00:13:51.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We’ll be meeting with the agency

248
00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:52.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-about Reira’s commercial appearance.
-Sexual harassment!

249
00:13:52.581 --> 00:13:54.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>We don’t need you here!</i>

250
00:13:54.291 --> 00:13:58.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, for the cosmetics.
That’s great, Reira.

251
00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:00.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’ll be admired even more

252
00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:01.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-by young girls across the country.
-I only wanna do jobs

253
00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:02.883 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that require singing!

254
00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop being selfish.

255
00:14:04.468 --> 00:14:06.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They’ll be using our song
for the commercial.

256
00:14:06.428 --> 00:14:08.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Takumi, I heard about Ren.

257
00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:10.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The sooner we have
a press conference, the better.

258
00:14:11.058 --> 00:14:13.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We should try
and move things along quickly.

259
00:14:15.479 --> 00:14:16.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bye!

260
00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:18.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
BLAH

261
00:14:18.774 --> 00:14:20.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Takumi! Why does even the president
suddenly want

262
00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:22.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ren and Nana to get married?

263
00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:24.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s the one who suggested it
in the first place!

264
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.741 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He wanted Ren to announce to the press
that he would protect Nana!

265
00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:29.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why now?

266
00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:34.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He said he doesn’t want Ren to look like
he was being used by a woman.

267
00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:37.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He thinks that by publicly declaring
that they are lovers,

268
00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:40.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the public will be left
with the impression

269
00:14:40.754 --> 00:14:42.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that BLAST became popular thanks to us.

270
00:14:42.464 --> 00:14:45.968 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That’s ridiculous!
-Well, he’s not very smart.

271
00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:48.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Simply saying "we’re getting married"

272
00:14:48.512 --> 00:14:51.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is more persuasive
and leaves a favorable impression.

273
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:56.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then Narita will be satisfied,
and we can put this silly party to rest.

274
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you want them to get married
for your own protection?

275
00:14:58.355 --> 00:14:59.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Actually, you disgust me!

276
00:14:59.273 --> 00:15:04.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What does the way you feel about me
have anything to do with Ren’s problems?

277
00:15:04.361 --> 00:15:08.574 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We’re talking business here!
That’s what I hate about you women!

278
00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then I’ll point this out strictly
from a business point of view.

279
00:15:19.043 --> 00:15:22.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The core of our fan base is young women.

280
00:15:22.546 --> 00:15:25.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With that in mind, I don’t think having
you and Ren getting married

281
00:15:25.466 --> 00:15:27.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
one after the other is such a great plan.

282
00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:30.554 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you seriously think all fans
support us for our music only,

283
00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:31.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you’re delusional.

284
00:15:33.807 --> 00:15:36.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I get it. Then it would be better
if just Ren got married, right?

285
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Why is Sachiko working
while you’re wandering around?

286
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We work different shifts.

287
00:15:49.156 --> 00:15:51.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’ve gotta work more,
so she can take it easy!

288
00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:54.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we split the bills fifty-fifty.

289
00:15:54.536 --> 00:15:56.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s one very reliable housewife.

290
00:15:57.039 --> 00:15:59.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’d say girls like you
who not only spend a lot

291
00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:02.711 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but rely on the earnings of others
to pay for it are a lot less common.

292
00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:06.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m glad you found a guy
with deep pockets.

293
00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:10.594 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, not that you’d know it,
but I’ve grown up a lot recently.

294
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:12.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know.

295
00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:15.891 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jun-chan, you blabbermouth…

296
00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So Nana, who are you going
to the fireworks with?

297
00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:19.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s a secret!

298
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:22.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We celebrities have many secrets
that we cannot tell the commoners.

299
00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:27.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So even if we run into each other,
don’t talk to me, okay?

300
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:29.113 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I’ll do the same.

301
00:16:42.209 --> 00:16:43.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
&lrm;POST OFFICE

302
00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:44.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really am sorry.

303
00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:54.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s okay. I had many faults too.

304
00:16:57.641 --> 00:17:03.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But thinking back,
none of your selfish whims were that bad.

305
00:17:05.816 --> 00:17:08.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I might annoy you by saying this,

306
00:17:08.485 --> 00:17:11.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I still enjoy talking with you.

307
00:17:12.573 --> 00:17:14.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m glad I could see you.

308
00:17:16.785 --> 00:17:18.412 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I won’t see you anymore.

309
00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Those with a record
must refrain, you know.

310
00:17:24.918 --> 00:17:26.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bye.

311
00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:41.393 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get going!

312
00:17:41.477 --> 00:17:44.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You go first. Where are you meeting?

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:49.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s a secret. I still have time,
so I think I’ll wander around a bit.

314
00:17:49.943 --> 00:17:53.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You sure like wandering,
even though you get lost easily.

315
00:17:53.864 --> 00:17:56.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t get lost anymore! Hurry up and go!

316
00:18:02.164 --> 00:18:04.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, by the way, when is she due? Sachiko.

317
00:18:04.374 --> 00:18:06.293 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The end of April.

318
00:18:07.961 --> 00:18:11.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s not possible that she’ll be late
and arrive on May 5th, is it?

319
00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:13.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why? It’s perfectly possible.

320
00:18:13.842 --> 00:18:15.302 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If she were born on that day,
Children’s Day,

321
00:18:15.385 --> 00:18:17.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it would be nice
because everyone would remember the day!

322
00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:20.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you sure it’s not
the Demon Lord’s child?

323
00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:21.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How dare you say something so ominous!

324
00:18:21.975 --> 00:18:24.269 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Children of the Demon Lord
can only be born on July 7th.

325
00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:25.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let’s hope so.

326
00:18:27.689 --> 00:18:29.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well then, take care of yourself.

327
00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:30.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give birth to a healthy human baby!

328
00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:58.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hachiko’s late, isn’t she?
-No, it’s only 5:30 p.m.

329
00:18:58.512 --> 00:19:01.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She doesn’t have a key,
so she won’t be here until six o’clock.

330
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? She doesn’t have a key?

331
00:19:07.229 --> 00:19:10.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yasu, you’re too funny!
I can’t continue a conversation like this!

332
00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:13.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mika and Masaru put
all that effort into it,

333
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so you shouldn’t be screwing around.

334
00:19:14.611 --> 00:19:17.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re the one who put it on me.
You even paid for it.

335
00:19:17.698 --> 00:19:21.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
With Yasu, placing wigs on him is so easy!

336
00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:24.413 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shin, quit talking like Misato.
You’re seriously cute like that.

337
00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:27.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That long hair looks
surprisingly good on you.

338
00:19:27.791 --> 00:19:29.626 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll bet Hachi will fall in love
with you all over again.

339
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I don’t want her to fall in love
with me for that reason.

340
00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:35.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It makes you look a bit like Shoji.
Though you’re shorter.

341
00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:38.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought so, too. Petite Shoji?

342
00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:40.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, he does look like him.
Although Nobu’s shorter.

343
00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:44.641 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Who is this Shoji?
And just how tall is he?

344
00:19:47.769 --> 00:19:48.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shoji!

345
00:19:55.819 --> 00:19:58.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s wrong? Your eyes are red.

346
00:19:58.238 --> 00:20:01.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Huh? My contact lenses are giving
me problems.

347
00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:04.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you have twenty-twenty vision.

348
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.248 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe I’m just far-sighted.

349
00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:11.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The further away something is,
the better I can see it.

350
00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:13.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But once it gets close,
I lose sight of it.

351
00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:18.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That could be the same with everyone.

352
00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:27.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let’s hold hands all night tonight,

353
00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:28.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so we don’t lose each other in the crowd,

354
00:20:29.853 --> 00:20:32.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
especially since you’re tiny.

355
00:20:37.444 --> 00:20:38.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Hey, Hachi…</i>

356
00:20:40.155 --> 00:20:42.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>They say you don’t realize</i>

357
00:20:42.157 --> 00:20:46.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>how much you care for someone</i>
<i>until after they’re gone.</i>

358
00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:50.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But I think it’s when you come</i>
<i>face to face with that person once more</i>

359
00:20:50.165 --> 00:20:52.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>that you truly recognize</i>
<i>your feelings for them.</i>

360
00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:58.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>If I saw everyone again right now…</i>

361
00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:02.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I know that I’d depend on them</i>
<i>just as much as I did back then.</i>

362
00:21:03.345 --> 00:21:07.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I’m scared of that.</i>
<i>That’s why I can’t move from this spot.</i>
