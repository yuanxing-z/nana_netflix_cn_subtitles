00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

10
00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:30.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you don’t use it right,
plastic could make it worse.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

13
00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:36.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

15
00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is it safe for someone

16
00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:45.540 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:50.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

with the paper bag

19
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

20
00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:54.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

21
00:02:56.384 --> 00:02:59.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:02.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

She’s got that guy,
who is like a tranquilizer.

27
00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

28
00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

38
00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:07.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

She was probably just hyperventilating.

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:49.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hyperventilation syndrome.
Also known simply as hyperventilation.

51
00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

52
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.377 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s caused by excessive breathing.

53
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The carbon dioxide levels

54
00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:57.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

56
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

59
00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

60
00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:09.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is called

61
00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Doctor, I don’t need you to share
your knowledge with me.

62
00:05:12.186 --> 00:05:14.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What the hell’s wrong with me?
Is it my lungs?

63
00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.
-Then is it my blood?

64
00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:17.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

65
00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:20.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then it must be because I smoke
even though I’m on the pill.

66
00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I heard that when you’re young,
a little is all right.

67
00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:24.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

68
00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:26.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s not good.

69
00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:27.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You risk getting thrombosis, you know.

70
00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know that, but I can’t quit either.

71
00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:32.248 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

72
00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:35.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you’d use protection instead,
then the problem’s solved.

73
00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:37.170 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:41.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, Doctor! You’re misunderstanding!

75
00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:42.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

76
00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.011 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My apologies. But in any case,

77
00:05:45.094 --> 00:05:47.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the examination shows
there is nothing wrong with you,

78
00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:48.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so you can relax.

79
00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:51.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

80
00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

You rogue doctor!

81
00:05:53.936 --> 00:05:54.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:05:57.231 --> 00:05:59.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hyperventilation can occur

84
00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:03.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

if you’re overly nervous or excited.

85
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:06.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

86
00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:09.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How can it be cured?

87
00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:13.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, there’s no guarantee
it’ll even happen again.

88
00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:15.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The best thing to do is
to not worry about it.

89
00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:19.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course I’ll be worried!
I’m a singer, Doctor!

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:22.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

91
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.175 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

when performing.

92
00:06:24.258 --> 00:06:26.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:33.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hmm… But this is stress-related,
which isn’t my area of expertise.

95
00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:37.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I suggest you see a psychiatrist.

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that if Nana has another attack,

00:13:05.993 --> 00:13:09.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we should stay calm and act

00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:11.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
