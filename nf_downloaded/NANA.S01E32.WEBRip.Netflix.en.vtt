BECAUSE HACHIKO'S NOT FEELING WELL,
I WON'T BE DROPPING BY FOR A WHILE.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.707 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

8
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.877 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
SO YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO LEAVE
THE STUDIO ANYWAY, RIGHT?

9
00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:17.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mr. Honjo.

10
00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:20.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mr. Honjo.

11
00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:23.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Excuse me.

12
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.937 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We’ve arrived at your place.

13
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How do you open the garage door?

14
00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:31.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, well, you insert the key there…

15
00:02:32.026 --> 00:02:33.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Key?

16
00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.533 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The key card. First you insert it…
Oh, such a drag.

17
00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:43.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Say, Kinoshita. How do you plan
to get home at this hour?

18
00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:45.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll take a taxi.

19
00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why not use this to go home?

20
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.877 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? Are you sure?

21
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, I would be happy

22
00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if you could come pick me up
in that tomorrow.

23
00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:54.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not a problem at all!

24
00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:57.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you’d like, I could use the company car
to pick you up and drop you off every day!

25
00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:02.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With the tough schedule you keep,
it would be dangerous driving every day.

26
00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:05.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Imagine if you got in an accident
and this car was totaled.

27
00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:07.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re more worried
about the car than about me.

28
00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:11.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you’re driving
a super rare 1965 Mustang Shelby!

29
00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:15.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't care what car I drive
so long as it moves,

30
00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:17.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but Takumi went through the trouble
of finding it for me.

31
00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:19.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Something about our image.

32
00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:24.662 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, Mr. Honjo,
you’ve got all this money and ability,

33
00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:25.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but you don’t desire much, do you?

34
00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:27.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even your songs.

35
00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You write them according
to Takumi’s instructions.

36
00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:35.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I believe your true talents
shine through when you play punk.

37
00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As long as I get to play the guitar,
anything will do.

38
00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:42.263 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I for one wanna hear
Ren Honjo's soul shout!

39
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You wanna hear my soul shout?

40
00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:48.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, well… But doing as Takumi says

41
00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:52.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is not something limited to you
and the other band members.

42
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t tell anyone I told you,
but everyone’s saying,

43
00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"We’re all soldiers serving under Takumi."

44
00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who’s everyone?

45
00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:03.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Um… But Takumi does have
the talents and decision-making skills

46
00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:05.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to back his actions.

47
00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:07.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He’s able to come through on what he says.

48
00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I respect him for that.

49
00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:12.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then tell this to "everyone."

50
00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:14.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If anyone’s not satisfied
with how Takumi does things,

51
00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they’re free to quit.

52
00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:19.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We don’t need any soldiers
who are unwilling to fight with us.

53
00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:25.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
THE PAPARAZZI ARE SO ANNOYING.

54
00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I’LL BE HIDING IN THE USUAL ROOM
AT THE USUAL HOTEL.

55
00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:30.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
COME IF YOU FEEL UP TO IT.

56
00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can’t come up with the lyrics.

57
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The theme is a love ballad
that’ll make people cry.

58
00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t come to me about it.

59
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why do they always have to be love songs,
just because they're more popular?

60
00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:46.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why do Japanese people like
love stories so much?

61
00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can’t I write a song about world peace?

62
00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:50.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, not that I could write
a song about that.

63
00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:54.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’ll I do? We begin recording tomorrow.

64
00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Technically, you begin today.

65
00:05:01.342 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shin, why are you being so cold today?

66
00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:07.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Am I? Maybe it’s
because I’m tired of being a good boy.

67
00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:09.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>A good boy?</i>

68
00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.102 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When are you good?

69
00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:13.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For this past month,
I haven’t skipped a day of practice.

70
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ve been respecting
the studio’s no smoking policy,

71
00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:18.651 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I’m playing music like
the director wants me to.

72
00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:20.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But this is getting real boring.

73
00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:25.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What? You’re not allowed to smoke
in Gaia’s rehearsal studios?

74
00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:27.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Usually, we’re allowed to smoke
even in the recording studios.

75
00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:30.163 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What musician would use such a place?

76
00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:32.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s a teaching studio.

77
00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:35.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s a professional
training school next door,

78
00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:37.253 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and students from there use the studio.

79
00:05:37.336 --> 00:05:41.507 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wow. There’s a school there.
Gaia’s pretty impressive.

80
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:44.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are the top students able
to debut as pros?

81
00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder. Doesn’t interest me.

82
00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:51.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
To be honest,
I don't care about the debut.

83
00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:54.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
If I could have fun playing in a band,
that’s good enough for me.

84
00:05:56.731 --> 00:06:00.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're right! Music is something
that should be enjoyed!

85
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.361 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let’s go out and dance all night
like crazy

86
00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:04.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to release some of that tension! Okay?

87
00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:09.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you saying?
This is your job, Reira.

88
00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:13.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re getting paid for this,
so you’ve gotta take it seriously.

89
00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:18.127 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, concentrate.

90
00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can release all your frustrations

91
00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:22.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
by writing down whatever's on your mind.

92
00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:26.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re right. Maybe I’ll write
about getting rid of them "mosquitoes."

93
00:06:26.427 --> 00:06:28.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you’re writing a love ballad, right?

94
00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:06.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Aren’t you hungry?
Can I call room service?

95
00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.905 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Reira was in love with Takumi.

96
00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:50.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a pretty song.

97
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:56.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ren is a genius indeed.

98
00:07:57.101 --> 00:08:02.482 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It'll be ruined by my shallow love story…

99
00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:06.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re wrong about that.

100
00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:10.531 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A love story written by someone
who can shed tears like that

101
00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:12.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
isn’t gonna be shallow.

102
00:08:13.117 --> 00:08:16.412 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The reason Trapnest has the support
of so many female fans

103
00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:20.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is because they can relate

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:23.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m impressed.
You’re really good with words.

105
00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:27.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For me, this is my job.
I make money from this.

106
00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:31.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m dead serious.

107
00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:47.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
FROM: NAOKI/TO: YASU - RECORDING BEGINS
TOMORROW, SO LET'S DRINK TONIGHT!

108
00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:50.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Don't you have any girl
to hang out with instead?

109
00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I do that, it’ll cause a scandal.

110
00:08:52.448 --> 00:08:54.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re too self conscious.

111
00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:58.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ren and Takumi are doing whatever
they want, and it hasn't been a problem.

112
00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:01.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has been a problem. A real problem.

113
00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The shutterbugs just won’t go away.

114
00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:06.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hear that female vocalist from your band
has been staying at Ren’s place.

115
00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:08.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would you please give her a lecture?

116
00:09:08.172 --> 00:09:10.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? The shutterbugs?

117
00:09:10.758 --> 00:09:12.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The paparazzi.
-Really?

118
00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:16.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. They’re targeting
all the band members,

119
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I’m the only one
being careful about it.

120
00:09:18.432 --> 00:09:21.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The company put Reira in a hotel
to protect her.

121
00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I'm pretty sure Takumi went
to see Hachiko today.

122
00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:27.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was looking restless all day
and rushed home the moment we were done.

123
00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:30.069 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-By Hachiko, do you mean…
-Nana.

124
00:09:30.152 --> 00:09:31.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ve never met her,

125
00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:34.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but from what I hear,
she knows how to control a man.

126
00:09:34.198 --> 00:09:35.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She’s really something.

127
00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:38.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One day, she says she wants to see you,
the next day she blocks your calls.

128
00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:42.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She’s a great strategist, not to mention
a great cook and great in bed.

129
00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even if not Takumi,
any guy would fall for a woman like that.

130
00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:46.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Impressive, I’d say. Who is she?

131
00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:49.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Naoki, you've got it wrong.

132
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Besides, I thought those two broke up.

133
00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I doubt that'll happen.

134
00:09:55.219 --> 00:09:57.263 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Takumi would never let a girl
he’s infatuated with

135
00:09:57.346 --> 00:09:58.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
run away so easily.

136
00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:02.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s such a fool, not realizing that
he’s playing into Hachiko’s hands.

137
00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:10.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Put an end to things first,</i>
<i>and then come to me.</i>

138
00:10:10.901 --> 00:10:13.529 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>But I did. That’s why I came.</i>

139
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.534 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why aren’t you saying anything?

140
00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:27.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Say something!
Are you gonna step up or just walk away?

141
00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:29.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>The baby's growing even as we speak!</i>

142
00:10:33.382 --> 00:10:35.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s the matter?

143
00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:36.510 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello, Hachiko?

144
00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Nana, you’re there, too?

145
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Takumi?

146
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.396 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Perfect timing.</i>
<i>I wanted to talk to you as well.</i>

147
00:10:48.105 --> 00:10:49.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you and Nobu come here now?

148
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m not getting anywhere over the phone.

149
00:10:51.942 --> 00:10:53.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Come where?</i>

150
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And why are you calling
from Hachiko’s cell phone?

151
00:10:56.447 --> 00:11:00.534 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m just borrowing it for a bit.
I’m at your place right now.

152
00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What are you doing at our place?</i>

153
00:11:02.536 --> 00:11:04.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How dare you fool around
with someone else’s woman!

154
00:11:04.538 --> 00:11:06.332 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hachi’s dating Nobu now!

155
00:11:06.415 --> 00:11:08.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know that, but…

156
00:11:08.292 --> 00:11:10.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s the one who fooled around
with someone else’s woman.

157
00:11:12.046 --> 00:11:14.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is Hachi there?
<i>-Yeah, she’s here.</i>

158
00:11:14.256 --> 00:11:16.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Let me talk to her.</i>
<i>It’s useless talking with you.</i>

159
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:23.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana, Nana wants to talk to you.

160
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.361 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Looks like she can't talk right now.

161
00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:37.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What did you do to her?</i>

162
00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:39.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I didn’t do anything.

163
00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:42.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anyway, we’ll be there right away!
We’re in the neighborhood!

164
00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Really? Then can you buy some grapefruits</i>

165
00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:47.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>and a bottle of sparkling water</i>
<i>on your way?</i>

166
00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:48.374 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

167
00:11:48.457 --> 00:11:50.501 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll squeeze the fruit
and have her drink it.

168
00:11:50.584 --> 00:11:52.128 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>She seems to be having</i>
<i>a really bad case of morning sickness.</i>

169
00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:54.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>She’s in pain. I’m counting on you, okay?</i>

170
00:12:10.229 --> 00:12:11.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Morning sickness?</i>

171
00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:19.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Morning sickness?</i>

172
00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:21.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>Yeah. I’ll have the grapefruit juice.</i>

173
00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Oh, but it’s just the summer heat.</i>
<i>I’m all right.</i>

174
00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:26.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I can’t really explain it.</i>
<i>Like, maternal instinct?</i>

175
00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:33.419 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobu… you…

176
00:12:33.502 --> 00:12:35.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you do it with Hachi,
do you use a condom?

177
00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:40.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Answer me!
-Of course I do.

178
00:12:40.843 --> 00:12:42.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Every time?
-Yeah.

179
00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:44.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-From before you insert?
-Yeah.

180
00:12:44.763 --> 00:12:47.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You liar! You must’ve done it at least
a bit without any protection!

181
00:12:47.641 --> 00:12:48.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never without protection!

182
00:12:50.978 --> 00:12:54.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you so damn serious all the time?

183
00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:02.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you saying?

184
00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:05.701 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is being serious a bad thing?

185
00:13:05.784 --> 00:13:07.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If she gets pregnant,
I don't have the money to raise a kid!

186
00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:09.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, of course!

187
00:13:15.669 --> 00:13:17.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then it’s Takumi’s child?

188
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you crying for?
I’m the one who wants to cry.

189
00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:22.593 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If it’s not your child, then say so!

190
00:13:22.676 --> 00:13:25.012 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I’m sure Hachi won’t have it!

191
00:13:25.095 --> 00:13:28.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't say that!
I'll sound like I'm irresponsible.

192
00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:29.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I did it with her too,

193
00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:31.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so the possibility of it being
my child is not zero percent.

194
00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:36.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides, Hachi probably already knows
that it’s Takumi’s child.

195
00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn’t that why she told him?

196
00:13:40.819 --> 00:13:43.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Otherwise, she wouldn’t be seeing him.

197
00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:46.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, there's no other reason.

198
00:13:47.451 --> 00:13:50.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s the one who fooled around
with someone else’s woman.

199
00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:01.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then you should become the father.

200
00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:10.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you saying?
Don’t make it sound so simple.

201
00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:13.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it’s about money,
I’m sure we can work it out!

202
00:14:14.061 --> 00:14:15.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We’ve got our debut coming up
for one thing.

203
00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:18.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I can’t imagine Takumi
becoming the guardian

204
00:14:18.148 --> 00:14:19.900 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of the child he had by accident!

205
00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He said he would…

206
00:14:22.903 --> 00:14:24.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
even if it were my child.

207
00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:27.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s just saying that
so he can keep Hachi to himself!

208
00:14:27.658 --> 00:14:30.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That man wants to take advantage
of the child to get her for himself!

209
00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Aren’t you doing the same?

210
00:14:33.414 --> 00:14:36.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re taking advantage of me
to get Hachi for yourself, right?

211
00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:43.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Cut it out already.
You are definitely screwed up.

212
00:14:43.924 --> 00:14:46.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you’re gonna insist,
why don’t you become the father?

213
00:14:49.763 --> 00:14:52.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although, I can’t imagine you feeling
any love for Takumi’s child.

214

216

<i>Don’t keep it!</i>

217
00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:28.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Those two are sure taking their time.

218
00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:34.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t get so stressed.
Right now, you need to lie down.

219
00:15:34.224 --> 00:15:35.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You wouldn’t want a miscarriage,
would you?

220
00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, I think you’ve gained
a little weight.

221
00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:43.734 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought women usually lose weight
during the days of morning sickness.

222
00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:48.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My older sister had a bad case
of morning sickness, too.

223
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.990 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was in eleventh grade,
and she was twenty.

224
00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:52.034 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She got married as a result.

225
00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:54.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Her husband is
a hard-working office worker,

226
00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:56.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a very reliable man, unlike me.

227
00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:00.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I got so pissed off when I found out,
and I beat him up pretty badly.

228
00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:04.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My sister cried, and Reira laughed at me
for being so possessive.

229
00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:07.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was horrible.

230
00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:12.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come to think of it,
you’re also twenty years old.

231
00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:15.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Though, you're not very mature
for your age.

232
00:16:15.933 --> 00:16:17.559 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You don’t have a full-time job,

233
00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:19.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and when you get lonely,
you’re quick to sleep with some guy.

234
00:16:19.937 --> 00:16:23.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And as luck would have it,
now you’re pregnant. You’re hopeless.

235
00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:24.900 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your parents are gonna cry.

236
00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:27.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But who am I to tell you this, right?

237
00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:34.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Regardless of whom the kid’s father is,

238
00:16:34.284 --> 00:16:36.412 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
there’s no mistake that
you are the mother.

239
00:16:37.454 --> 00:16:38.914 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So pull yourself together.

240
00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:54.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They’re finally here.

241
00:17:18.203 --> 00:17:21.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re late. I thought you ran away.

242
00:17:22.332 --> 00:17:25.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? You’re alone? What about Nana?

243
00:17:25.252 --> 00:17:26.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I dunno.

244
00:17:26.795 --> 00:17:30.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Geez, she hasn’t gone off
to Ren’s place again, has she?

245
00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:33.427 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, did you get the grapefruits?

246
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:34.386 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

247
00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:37.014 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
GARLIC PICKLED IN SOY SAUCE

248
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re not very thoughtful, are you?

249
00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:43.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never mind. I’ll go buy some.

250
00:17:43.854 --> 00:17:47.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s not really something the three of us
can have a friendly chat about anyway.

251
00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:51.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The choice is Nana’s.
The child doesn’t need two fathers, right?

252
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana… Is it true that you’re pregnant?

253
00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:22.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, I wanna hear it directly from you.

254
00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:25.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It could be my child.
There’s no need to hide it from me.

255
00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:29.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I knew that you had
just broken up with Takumi.

256
00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:32.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry.

257
00:18:43.997 --> 00:18:47.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why… are you apologizing?

258
00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:50.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Didn’t you break up with him?

259
00:19:08.355 --> 00:19:11.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please make up an excuse.

260
00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:16.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t care if it’s a lie.
I’ll believe you.

261
00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:21.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry.

262
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

265
00:19:44.224 --> 00:19:47.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s embarrassing,
so don’t read it out loud!

266
00:19:47.102 --> 00:19:51.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even I find it bad.
I should hire a ghostwriter to write it.

267
00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:57.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Say, what’s the meaning
of this red string?

268
00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:59.907 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-No.

269
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s an invisible string of fate
that’s tied onto the pinky

00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:04.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Wow. I bet girls fall
for that sort of stuff.

272
00:20:08.081 --> 00:20:12.336 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I’m not interested
in such theories of fate.

273
00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:14.421 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It doesn’t matter about the relationship.

274
00:20:14.504 --> 00:20:17.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I believe people are bound by trust.

275
00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:20.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is that what you mean by
"This hand you've held"?

276
00:20:21.428 --> 00:20:24.556 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe it’s sour grapes because
I haven’t found that special someone.

277
00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
