18
00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:28.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is a butterfly.
But that kind is called a swallowtail.

23

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

30
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.825 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

31
00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.537 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

122
00:11:13.297 --> 00:11:17.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

123
00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:29.980 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

124
00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:34.902 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He backed out at the last minute.
What a chicken.

125

00:11:54.463 --> 00:11:55.673 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

130
00:12:05.766 --> 00:12:07.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where are you going, Nobu?

131
00:12:08.477 --> 00:12:09.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m going home.

132
00:12:10.229 --> 00:12:12.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If she says she doesn’t wanna see me,
then I can’t stay.

133
00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:15.401 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She didn’t say that!

134
00:12:15.484 --> 00:12:19.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She says she’s scared to see you.
Hachi’s still in love with you!

135
00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.740 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Stop twisting things around
to how you want them to be!

136
00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:25.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I just know what it’s like
to be so scared

137
00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:29.081 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of being swept away again!

138
00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:34.128 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She’s marrying Takumi in two weeks.

139
00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:35.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s right around the corner.

140
00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:37.882 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But if you two fell back in love now,

141
00:12:37.965 --> 00:12:39.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hachi would be stuck
in an impossible situation!

142
00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:41.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course she’s scared!

143
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All the more reason
why I shouldn’t see her.

144
00:12:47.057 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can’t you just get stuck with her?

145
00:12:59.778 --> 00:13:00.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Forget it.

146
00:13:02.239 --> 00:13:04.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After all, you probably just wanted
to comfort Hachi

147
00:13:04.116 --> 00:13:06.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
who had been dumped by her old boyfriend

148
00:13:07.036 --> 00:13:08.704 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and was being used by Takumi.

149
00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:11.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You never really loved her.
-I do love her!

150
00:13:11.707 --> 00:13:12.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you know?

151
00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:15.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But now you love
that girl next door, right?

152
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hear that girl has
the same condition as me.

153
00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:22.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She can’t even go to work
without her medication.

154
00:13:22.426 --> 00:13:26.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what?
She’s trying her best in spite of that!

155
00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:31.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Since long ago,
you’ve always loved helpless girls

156
00:13:31.685 --> 00:13:35.731 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who are stuck in some sort of situation
you had absolutely nothing to do with.

157
00:13:36.732 --> 00:13:39.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That way, you can always play
the part of the hero, right?

158
00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:41.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana, cut it out.

159
00:13:41.695 --> 00:13:44.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But then, the moment you feel
you’re being pulled in,

160
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you let go of her hand.

161
00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:50.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nobu, she’s just provoking you.
Don’t mind her.

162
00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:59.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What an easygoing form of love.</i>

163
00:14:13.852 --> 00:14:17.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana can be really cruel.

164
00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:21.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She’s purposely trying to push them
into an impossible situation.

165
00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:22.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course Nobu would react

166
00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:25.906 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and get serious from the way
he was confronted.

167
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hachi’s gonna end up suffering even more.

168
00:14:31.328 --> 00:14:34.081 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobu is a pacifist.

169
00:14:34.164 --> 00:14:37.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He’s always tried his hardest to choose

170
00:14:37.793 --> 00:14:41.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the path that would make everyone happy.

171
00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:46.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t think trying to avoid conflict
is the same as being easygoing.

172
00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:51.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I agree.

173
00:14:52.516 --> 00:14:56.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After all, it’s a battle
against his own desires.

174
00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:04.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What would you like?

175
00:15:05.029 --> 00:15:06.947 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Miss? How many do you want?

176
00:15:08.198 --> 00:15:09.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Three.

177
00:15:20.377 --> 00:15:23.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I’ll do everything I can</i>

178

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

182
00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:26.902 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s been a while
since I’ve seen fireworks.

183
00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They sure are pretty.

184
00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the first time I’ve ever had
food from a food stand.

185
00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:32.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-What?

186
00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:34.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s pretty good!

187
00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:37.663 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it’s hard to eat with chopsticks.

188
00:16:38.205 --> 00:16:40.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder if any of the stands have forks.

189
00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:42.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
D-- Don’t spoil him! Make him practice!

190
00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:43.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t grab me so suddenly!

191
00:16:43.711 --> 00:16:45.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My wig will shift!

192

195
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm at the apartment,
but no one’s answering.

196

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:13.741 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. We couldn’t wait
any longer and left. Sorry.

201
00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:17.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I should be the one apologizing
for being late.

202
00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:21.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:25.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. Got it.
I’ll call again if I can’t find you.

They’re so pretty! Awesome!

211
00:18:15.052 --> 00:18:16.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They really are pretty, aren’t they?

212
00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.641 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come on, Shin.
You’re sounding like Misato!

213
00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:23.102 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a huge diamond.

214
00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:30.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, Nobu aside, why aren’t you
inviting me to your wedding?

215
00:18:30.317 --> 00:18:31.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You did invite Yasu and Shin.

216
00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:33.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? You’d come?

217
00:18:33.695 --> 00:18:35.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course I would.

218
00:18:35.697 --> 00:18:38.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll even sing you the punk version
of Ladybugs’ "Samba".

219
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s that? What kind of song is it?

220
00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:42.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll buy you the CD

221
00:18:42.329 --> 00:18:43.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so you can arrange it
and play the guitar part.

222
00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:46.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You be happy, no matter what, okay?

223
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobu stepped aside so that you’d be happy.

224
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So if you end up unhappy,
it was for nothing.

225
00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:02.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, with Takumi as your husband,

226
00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:05.477 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m sure he’s gonna make you cry
from time to time.

227
00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:07.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you’re the fool who fell
in love with him,

228
00:19:07.354 --> 00:19:08.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so that can’t be helped.

229
00:19:10.023 --> 00:19:13.902 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And don’t get discouraged when he cheats
on you now and then, all right?

230
00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:17.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just smack him around
until you feel better.

231
00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:24.955 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. You’re right.
