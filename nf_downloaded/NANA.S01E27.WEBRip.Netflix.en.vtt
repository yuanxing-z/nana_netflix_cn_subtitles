25
00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:22.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

26
00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:25.163 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

28
00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:31.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

29
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

30
00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:35.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so if you wanna apologize,
do it in the evening.

31
00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

32
00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:41.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

38
00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:03.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, I’ve been thinking from before…

39
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hachi’s a really good cook.

40
00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:09.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think so? I think she’s normal.

41
00:04:17.548 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll leave the leftovers,

42
00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.554 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so share them with Shin
and have Yasu come over, too.

43
00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:25.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll tell him to drop by
on his way back from work.

44
00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:27.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

nicer for all of us

45
00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:29.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

46
00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:31.104 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We should also say hi
to Misato while we’re at it.

47
00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:34.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do as you wish. I’ve got work tonight,

48
00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:35.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I’ll have some of this cake
while I still have the chance.

49
00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:38.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it would be a shame to cut it.

50
00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:39.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

52
00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:42.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

65
00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:00.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

66
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

67
00:06:03.404 --> 00:06:08.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

109
00:08:45.816 --> 00:08:48.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Welcome home, Ms. Hachiko!
Everyone’s been waiting for you!

110
00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:50.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Huh?
-We’re celebrating.

111
00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.532 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They just got a contract
with the record company!

112
00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:54.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We haven’t signed it yet, though.

113
00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:57.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like I said, what reason
do you have to hesitate?

114
00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.413 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well… There are a number of things.

115
00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:01.374 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hachi!

116
00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:05.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry. Your cake was delicious.

117
00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Shin.</i>

118

<i>Make me your wife.</i>

119
00:09:12.593 --> 00:09:14.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, Shin! What are you doing?

120
00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:18.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Unable to play the guitar or piano,</i>

121
00:09:18.766 --> 00:09:21.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I could never become a member of BLAST…</i>

122
00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:27.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But no one can surpass the love</i>
<i>I feel for BLAST and their music.</i>

123
00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:32.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>And I swear to this for as long as I live.</i>

124
00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:41.998 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In my opinion.
a straight-up punk band like us

125
00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:44.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
will do better in the long run
if we take our time

126
00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:48.296 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and go around on our own for a while
building a fan base

127
00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:51.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
rather than suddenly going big
and signing with a record company.

128
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why?
-Why?

129
00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.306 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sure, there are many artists
as good as pros

130
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:59.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who haven’t signed a contract
with a major label,

131
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but if you’re planning
on going pro eventually anyway,

132
00:10:01.892 --> 00:10:04.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
why do it in such a roundabout way?

133
00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:06.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have an offer on the table
from an industry leader.

134
00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.524 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You seem to know your stuff, Misato.

135
00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.318 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When it comes to going pro,

136
00:10:10.401 --> 00:10:13.529 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
our queen, for one,
is feeling a sense of urgency,

137
00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:14.780 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I had initially thought
if we’re gonna do this anyway,

138
00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:16.741 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
why not go big and become pro?

139
00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:18.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, after thinking it
through some more…

140
00:10:18.909 --> 00:10:22.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on. You don’t need to think so much!

141
00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:23.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know you wanna look before you leap,

142
00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:25.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but we can't be paralyzed by fear.

143
00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:29.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However, in the world of the major labels,
everything’s driven by sales.

144
00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:31.505 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even if you come up with a hit song,
unless you follow it up with another hit,

145
00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:33.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the public will be quick to desert you.

146
00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Once you’re left with the image
of being a one-hit wonder,

147
00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:37.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it’ll be extremely difficult
to make a comeback.

148
00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:39.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see. In other words, you’re saying

149
00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.306 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it would be better
to get established first

150
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:42.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
by attracting fans
that will stick with you,

151
00:10:42.224 --> 00:10:44.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then switch to a major label
once you’ve built that foundation.

152
00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s right.
Besides, with our current position,

153
00:10:47.855 --> 00:10:51.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we’d pretty much have to agree to
a contract that favors the record company.

154
00:10:51.108 --> 00:10:52.276 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you mean money?

155
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, various things.

156
00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:57.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if we build a reputation,
there will be more offers to go pro,

157
00:10:57.865 --> 00:10:59.533 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and we’d be able to choose

158
00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:01.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the one that provides the best conditions.

159
00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:03.454 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t care about the terms!

160
00:11:03.537 --> 00:11:05.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let’s go pro and take
our chances from there!

161
00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:06.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We simply need to sell songs, right?

162
00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:07.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s right, that’s right!

163
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But to be honest, in your present state,

164
00:11:09.877 --> 00:11:14.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t believe you can write
several marketable songs in a row.

165
00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:18.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nonsense! Sure, he can!
Like, he already has!

166
00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:21.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Think about it!
I’m not a big fan of punk music,

167
00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:24.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and frankly, I’ve never been
interested in punk music at all!

168
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I only know the Sex Pistols

169
00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:27.061 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because I watched that movie,
"Sid and Nancy"!

170
00:11:27.144 --> 00:11:28.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And even then, I was left with the feeling

171
00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:30.731 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that I don’t really understand punk music!

172
00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:33.734 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that so?

173
00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:37.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry.

174
00:11:37.905 --> 00:11:41.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But… I like the songs Nobu writes.

175
00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:45.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it’s not that I’m favoring
his music because we’re friends.

176
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:47.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ve thought so ever since
I heard his music for the first time.

177
00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:48.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was totally surprised!

178
00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:50.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was deeply moved!

179
00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:51.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s so cool, it gave me goose bumps.

180
00:11:51.585 --> 00:11:52.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There is no way you won’t sell.

181
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know… Hachi…

182
00:11:55.172 --> 00:11:57.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s okay, I understand.

183
00:11:57.466 --> 00:12:00.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you. Don’t say another word.

184
00:12:00.177 --> 00:12:02.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m so happy I could cry.

185
00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:09.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I also think you’re capable
of writing songs that will be popular.

186
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:10.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

187
00:12:10.688 --> 00:12:14.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With the original BLAST,
Ren wrote most of the songs,

188
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:18.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I do believe the music appealed
to only the hardcore fans.

189
00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:20.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But compared to Ren’s music,
Nobu’s music is closer to pop.

190
00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:22.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With a little work,
I think the music could gain support

191
00:12:22.366 --> 00:12:23.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
from a wide range of listeners.

192
00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:27.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Ren’s songs are very popular
with the general public.

193
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s because now he’s writing songs
to suit the Trapnest style,

194
00:12:30.499 --> 00:12:32.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
as a professional.

195
00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:35.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. You’re very knowledgeable, Misato.

196
00:12:35.337 --> 00:12:36.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m impressed.

197
00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m impressed with Ren.

198
00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:40.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He not only creates songs
to suit the band,

199
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:42.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the songs he does write
become major hits.

200
00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:45.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the reason Trapnest’s songs
are so popular

201
00:12:45.764 --> 00:12:47.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
has more to do with Takumi’s arrangements.

202
00:12:48.517 --> 00:12:50.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No matter what kind of song,
if it falls into Takumi’s hands,

203
00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:53.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
he can make it fit into Trapnest’s style.

204
00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:56.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, I’ve always wondered,

205
00:12:56.108 --> 00:13:00.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
doesn’t Ren mind having Takumi
completely change the music he writes?

206
00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:04.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, don't most bands
arrange their songs together?

207
00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:07.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wouldn’t wanna be ordered
to play in a certain way.

208
00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:11.540 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's listening to the opinions
of others, it seems.

209
00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He seems to trust his band members.

210
00:13:14.001 --> 00:13:16.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In the past, Takumi used
to write the songs too,

211
00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:18.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so it was a complete one-man band.

212
00:13:18.088 --> 00:13:20.591 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And that led to clashes,
which is why back in their amateur days,

213
00:13:20.674 --> 00:13:23.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
the band members kept changing, right?

214
00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Naoki is their second drummer,
and Ren is their fourth guitarist.

215
00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:29.225 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You really know all the details.

216
00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:31.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anyone would be uncomfortable
in such a band.

217
00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:34.730 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course, Ren knew all this
when he joined Trapnest, right?

218
00:13:34.813 --> 00:13:39.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. But Ren supported
Takumi’s beliefs from the start.

219
00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:40.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s this belief?

220
00:13:44.448 --> 00:13:47.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’d say, "I’m the only one
who can create a sound

221
00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:50.454 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that would bring out the ultimate
beauty in Reira’s voice."

222
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, wow. I just thought
for a moment how cool that was.

223
00:13:55.876 --> 00:13:56.877 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Me too.

224
00:13:56.961 --> 00:14:00.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But didn't it make you jealous,

225
00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:02.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
having him talk
about your girlfriend like that?

226
00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:03.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How do you know about that?

227
00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:06.178 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I believe there’s very little data
I don’t know

228
00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:08.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when it comes to anything to do
with local bands from my hometown.

229
00:14:08.597 --> 00:14:11.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I will stop at nothing
until I know everything. It is my belief!

230
00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:13.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is that so?
But we split up a long time ago.

231
00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:14.770 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know!

232
00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:16.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had no idea.

233
00:14:17.064 --> 00:14:20.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Jealous? Should I be feeling jealous?</i>

234
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>That’s a strong bond</i>
<i>we’re talking about here.</i>

235
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>They could even be a couple.</i>
<i>It’s Takumi we’re talking about.</i>

236
00:14:26.156 --> 00:14:27.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>This is no time to be thinking</i>
<i>how cool that sounded.</i>

237
00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:32.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We kinda got off subject.

238
00:14:32.788 --> 00:14:34.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The issue here is not about Trapnest.

239
00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:36.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s about the future of our band.

240
00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:38.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, that’s right. I’m sorry.

241
00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:40.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Geez. You always change
the subject like that

242
00:14:40.337 --> 00:14:42.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
whenever it turns to you.

243
00:14:42.172 --> 00:14:45.593 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I feel like there's something wrong</i>
<i>with me for not being jealous.</i>

244
00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:48.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But we shouldn’t be making
any decisions about the band

245
00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:49.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
without Nana present.

246
00:14:49.513 --> 00:14:50.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s right.

247
00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:52.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, what time is Nana returning?

248
00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:54.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, she said she’d be working,
so she might not make it.

249
00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:56.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>No way. Nana isn’t coming?</i>

250
00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I haven’t seen her for days.</i>

251
00:14:59.648 --> 00:15:03.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Well, I did see her on stage yesterday,</i>
<i>but that was one-sided.</i>

252
00:15:04.778 --> 00:15:08.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, Hachi. We’re outta wine.
Will you go buy some?

253
00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:11.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it’s not safe alone,
so take Nobu with you.

254
00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:13.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You go buy it yourself.

255
00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:17.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I’m obviously under the age limit,
so they won’t sell me any.

256
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s okay, Hachi, I’ll go alone.

257
00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:21.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or rather, don’t come.

258
00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:22.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s no good.

259
00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:25.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's borderline whether or not
you look old enough.

260
00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:28.302 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Hachi’s looking sexier lately,
so she’ll be okay.

261
00:15:28.385 --> 00:15:30.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Sexier?
-So go.

262
00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:33.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>

263
00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:37.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>If it’s just the two of us,</i>
<i>I don’t know what I’m gonna say.</i>

264
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:42.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know…

265
00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:44.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s no point in me coming with you
if you’re gonna keep such a distance.

266
00:15:44.902 --> 00:15:49.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At least walk in front of me.
I’d worry if I can’t see you.

267
00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:51.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

268
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Actually, I’d rather not walk in front!

269
00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:07.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel uneasy about someone
walking behind me!

270
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, sorry… but…

271
00:16:11.261 --> 00:16:13.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it okay if I walk next to you?

272
00:16:13.722 --> 00:16:15.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’d rather you do that, please.

273
00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:26.318 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank you!
-F-- For what?

274
00:16:27.403 --> 00:16:32.116 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought you would never talk
to me again…

275
00:16:32.783 --> 00:16:35.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I’m glad that you came tonight.

276
00:16:37.121 --> 00:16:38.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you talking about?

277
00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s nonsense.
Of course I'll talk to you.

278
00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:43.711 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry.

279
00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:47.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why are you apologizing?
You’ve done nothing wrong.

280
00:16:47.464 --> 00:16:49.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s not true.

281
00:16:49.383 --> 00:16:53.929 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The truth is, I’m a really horrible woman!

282
00:16:57.307 --> 00:16:59.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you mean horrible?

283
00:16:59.226 --> 00:17:00.436 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How horrible?

284
00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:03.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it’s true.
You’re idealizing me for sure, Nobu!

285
00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:06.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Otherwise, there’s no way
you’d fall in love with me!

286
00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:11.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Aren’t you idealizing the creature</i>

287
00:17:12.322 --> 00:17:16.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you knew the real me,
you'd be disappointed.

288
00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:18.245 --> 00:17:20.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

290
00:17:26.503 --> 00:17:28.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then disappoint me.

291
00:17:29.214 --> 00:17:30.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want you to.

292
00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:36.847 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because I don’t know what else
I can do to stop loving you.

293
00:17:49.651 --> 00:17:53.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, Yasu, tell me the rest of the story
we were talking about earlier…

294
00:17:53.864 --> 00:17:55.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:55.115 --> 00:17:56.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

296
00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:58.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

297
00:17:58.202 --> 00:18:00.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Didn’t you get jealous
after hearing Takumi’s beliefs?

298
00:18:02.539 --> 00:18:05.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

299
00:18:05.334 --> 00:18:06.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

300
00:18:06.877 --> 00:18:08.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was jealous of his talent,

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.715 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
his confidence

302
00:18:12.716 --> 00:18:15.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

a high-performance machine
that will never feel tired.

313
00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:55.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But if I throw away my emotions,

314
00:18:55.843 --> 00:18:57.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it would be impossible
to sing beautifully, wouldn’t it?

315
00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:01.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Being human is exhausting.</i>

316
00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:03.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She captured my heart.

317
00:19:03.183 --> 00:19:07.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So then I convinced her to give up on him
and go out with me.

318
00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:08.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You convinced her.

319
00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:10.774 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But then when I started dating her,

320
00:19:10.858 --> 00:19:14.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I felt even stronger that
I could not compete against Takumi.

321
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:17.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looking back,
I know it was just petty jealousy.

322
00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.534 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I couldn’t bring myself
to be there for Reira

323
00:19:20.617 --> 00:19:21.785 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
when she had issues with the band

324
00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:24.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and when she was worried
about moving to Tokyo.

325
00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:28.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I couldn’t support her
when she needed me the most.

326
00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:30.419 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So not surprisingly, we broke up.

327
00:19:32.212 --> 00:19:35.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But couldn’t you support her now, Yasu?

328
00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:40.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. I doubt she needs my support anymore.

329
00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:43.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And besides, my hands are full
taking care of you guys right now.

330
00:19:46.602 --> 00:19:49.104 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I have to say goodbye to Takumi.</i>

331
00:19:49.688 --> 00:19:53.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>If I can’t do that, then</i>
<i>I must free myself from these arms.</i>

332
00:19:54.234 --> 00:19:58.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I can say goodbye, can’t I? I can.</i>

333
00:19:58.238 --> 00:20:00.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>It’ll be okay.</i>

334
00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:02.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>And this time for sure,</i>
<i>I'll be really happy.</i>

335
00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:09.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Because in these arms is</i>

336
00:20:09.124 --> 00:20:10.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>That’s what I believe.</i>

337
00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where’s Hachiko?

338
00:20:13.295 --> 00:20:14.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, she went to buy some stuff.

339
00:20:14.963 --> 00:20:18.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gimme a break. Did I just miss her again?

340
00:20:18.175 --> 00:20:21.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And after rushing to get here faster.
-She’ll be back soon.

341
00:20:21.345 --> 00:20:22.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She might be a while.

342
00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:24.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

343
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We sent her out with Nobu.

344
00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:29.311 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really? Way to go, Shin!

345
00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:31.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t come back until the morning!
I’m counting on you, Nobu!

346
00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:33.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Huh? But I thought
Ms. Hachiko has a boyfriend.

347
00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:35.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I bet 10,000 yen that they’ll do it.

348
00:20:35.442 --> 00:20:37.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I bet 10,000 yen that they won’t.

349
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:38.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I bet 100 yen that he’ll come
before they even do it!

350
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:40.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re so cheap.

351
00:20:51.708 --> 00:20:52.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Hey, Nana.</i>

352
00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:59.591 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>The feelings I swore that night</i>

353
00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:06.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Those shining dreams we had back then,</i>
