00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:36.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:36.492 --> 00:09:39.078 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:41.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:46.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:55.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

221
00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:38.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:39.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:46.046 --> 00:16:49.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What the hell kind of agency is
"Shikai Corporation"?

267
00:16:49.633 --> 00:16:51.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why are there adult film actresses

268
00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:54.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, she did start out as an idol.

269
00:16:54.888 --> 00:16:56.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But when her popularity dipped,
she took her clothes off.

270
00:16:56.557 --> 00:16:58.767 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know a lot about her, Yasu.

271
00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:03.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And how could you make the dormitory coed?

272
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s borderline outrageous!

273
00:17:04.773 --> 00:17:07.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m guessing it’s to accommodate
or shelter their talents

274
00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:08.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

275
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:12.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like Ginpei was saying,
they just call it a dormitory.

276
00:17:12.239 --> 00:17:15.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re right. But Ms. Yuri’s been
in so many adult films,

277
00:17:15.743 --> 00:17:17.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so she must have money.

278
00:17:17.327 --> 00:17:19.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So why is she living
in a shabby place like this?

279
00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:20.539 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>Ms. Yuri?</i>

280
00:17:20.622 --> 00:17:23.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Nobu! Switch rooms with me.
-Huh?

281
00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:25.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With a starving wolf like

282
00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:26.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Ms. Yuri" would be in danger!

283
00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:29.798 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I’m not gonna do anything! She’s a pro!
-I don’t care! Just switch!

284
00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:33.844 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you always so bossy?

285
00:17:33.927 --> 00:17:37.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nobu, I couldn’t care less
if you get off on porn videos,

286
00:17:37.973 --> 00:17:41.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but I hope you haven’t forgotten our plan.

287
00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:43.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Plan?

288
00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:48.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To get Hachiko back!
We pledged to fight together!

289
00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:50.277 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So don’t get involved with other women!

290
00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you saying?
You’re misunderstanding.

291
00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:54.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Misunderstanding?

292
00:17:55.657 --> 00:17:58.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were bashfully

293
00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:00.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, not that.

294
00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:06.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m not necessarily fighting
to get Hachi back.

295
00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:08.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And this is unrelated to that.

296
00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:11.048 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For me, Hachi and the band
are separate issues.

297
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:17.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides, why do I have
to take care of Hachi

298
00:18:17.304 --> 00:18:19.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
just so you can own her in your yard?

299
00:18:19.306 --> 00:18:21.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Honestly speaking,
I have completely given up on her,

300
00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:23.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so do whatever you wish on your own.

301
00:18:25.562 --> 00:18:29.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

302
00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:33.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then what are we fighting for?

303
00:18:33.821 --> 00:18:35.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

304
