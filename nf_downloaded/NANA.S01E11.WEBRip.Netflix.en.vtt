00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:10.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm broke!

6
00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Naturally.

7
00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:19.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But why? I worked so hard
and saved up before coming here,

8
00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:21.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
yet I only have 2,228 yen left.

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:23.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you spend your money, it runs out.

10
00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:29.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You went on this crazy spending splurge
of clothes and furniture.

11
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:32.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Mr. Mizukoshi gave me a good deal
on everything I got from there.

12
00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:34.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On top of that, rather than cash,

13
00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he offered to deduct the amount
for the clothes I got from my salary.

14
00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:40.076 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s why you didn’t have
much of a salary last month.

15
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s right! Isn’t it horrible?

16
00:02:41.786 --> 00:02:43.955 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do you think I was tricked?
-You did it to yourself!

17
00:02:44.038 --> 00:02:46.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What about you? Do you have
enough money to get by, Nana?

18
00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:50.253 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don’t have a full-time job,
just temporary stuff from time to time.

19
00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:53.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Unlike you, I don’t waste my money.

20
00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:55.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank goodness.
-Don’t rely on someone else’s money!

21
00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.135 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have no intention of doing so.

22
00:02:57.218 --> 00:02:58.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then what did you mean?

23
00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:01.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You see, if we both didn’t have money,
it would lead to anxiety, don’t you think?

24
00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:03.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You are relying on my money!
Don’t count on it!

25
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We agreed to split the rent
for this place by exactly half.

26
00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.856 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you can’t make arrangements
for funds by the end of the month,

27
00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m kicking you out.

28
00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:14.611 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You devil!
-Huh?

29
00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It wouldn’t bother you if I laid
in the streets dying, would it, Nana?

30
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dying once may do you good!

31
00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please, don’t abandon me!

32
00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:21.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let go of me! I’ll be late for work.

33
00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:22.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Work?

34
00:03:23.077 --> 00:03:25.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What kind of work are you doing
at this hour of the night?

35
00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:26.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it an S&amp;M club?

36
00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you care?

37
00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:30.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have a good night with the ghosts.

38
00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:34.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way…

39
00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:40.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>No. This is no time</i>

42
00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:47.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Can I survive on 2,000 yen?</i>

43
00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:49.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What am I to do? This is getting scary.</i>

44
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.565 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Having no money is scary!</i>

45
00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:57.362 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn’t come to Tokyo to experience this!

46
00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:00.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then why did you come?

47
00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:06.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To make it on my own?

48
00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then solve this on your own.

49
00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:09.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But how?

50
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s for you to figure out!

51
00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I don’t know how to be a dominatrix!

52
00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:14.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A dominatrix?

53
00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:17.507 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Talk to Shoji and have him feed you
until the end of the month.

54
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can’t do that.

55
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:21.177 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I talk to Shoji about this,
he’ll hate me

56
00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and for sure no longer wanna be with me.

57
00:04:23.554 --> 00:04:26.641 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Also he’s very busy with work
and his studies at university,

58
00:04:26.724 --> 00:04:29.102 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I’d only be a nuisance
bothering him at this late hour.

59
00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:31.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You got that right!

60
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I get it, Nana. So don’t cry.

61
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:36.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Use this to hold you over
until the end of the month.

62
00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:42.740 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kyosuke! We cannot afford that!

63
00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:45.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m not giving it to her.
It’s just a loan.

64
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.998 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No way. Give Nana cash, and you’re certain
it’ll be all gone in a day.

65
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:52.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s a cruel thing to say, Jun-chan.

66
00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:55.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-Rice.

67
00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.171 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My parents sent me some.
I’ll share it with you.

68
00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:00.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can feast on this

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:29.078 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

76
00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.955 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

But that’s unfortunate.

90

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:26.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

94
00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:28.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.786 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I can make it.

104
00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:53.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's great!

105
00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, right. About yesterday…

106
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? What?

107
00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you saying? That’s crazy!

108
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it’s the truth!

109
00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:05.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I really think you should pick
your friends more carefully.

110
00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:07.552 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But like I said,
she’s usually a really good girl.

111
00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:09.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t believe that.

112
00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:12.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ow!

113
00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:14.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yo!

114
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I get it.

115
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I was just as surprised.

116
00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:27.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have the same employer,
go to the same university,

117
00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:29.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and are enrolled in the same faculty.

118
00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:31.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Guess you pretty much have to get along.

119
00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:33.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, but Sachiko was accepted
on her first try,

120
00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:34.620 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so she’s two years younger.

121
00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:35.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sachiko?

122
00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:39.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can’t help it.
She asked me to call her that.

123
00:07:39.083 --> 00:07:40.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There was no reason to refuse.

124
00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:45.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She’s clearly your type,
petite and fair-skinned.

125
00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can’t help it.

126
00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:47.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I’m telling you, it’s not like that!

127
00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:50.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m proud that you’re holding back.

128
00:07:50.928 --> 00:07:51.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She’s back.

129
00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:57.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here, Shoji. Is coffee okay?

130
00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:58.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Thanks.

131
00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:01.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mr. Kyosuke, which would you prefer?

132
00:08:01.772 --> 00:08:04.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just call me Kyosuke, Sa-chan.

133
00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s gonna be trouble.

134
00:08:12.116 --> 00:08:13.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

135
00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:18.873 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I’m more for the dark-skinned
big girls like you, but…

136
00:08:18.956 --> 00:08:22.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Well, excuse me for my dark skin.

137
00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:26.881 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But even I find her cute.
This is definitely bad.

138
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So cool!

139
00:09:19.183 --> 00:09:21.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shin, I didn’t notice you there.

140
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:22.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Awesome.

141
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I never knew you could play
the drums too, Nana.

142
00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:27.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I can’t.
-But you were!

143
00:09:27.608 --> 00:09:29.318 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is all I know.

144
00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you’re good. When did you learn?

145
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Back home while I was in a band,
I learned it for fun.

146
00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:37.785 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
From Yasu?

147
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.663 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why do you know about Yasu?

148
00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:44.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because when Nobu gets drunk,
he always talks about Yasu.

149
00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:47.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Last night too, he kept saying
how he wished that Yasu was here.

150
00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:50.590 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You stayed over at Nobu’s place again?

151
00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:51.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Those are Nobu’s clothes, aren’t they?

152
00:09:52.049 --> 00:09:55.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nobu’s at work right now
and said he may be a bit late.

153
00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:59.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shin, you should return home
once in a while.

154
00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:02.393 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll bet your parents are worried.

155
00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:04.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They’re not.

156
00:10:04.937 --> 00:10:07.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really? Then it’s fine, I guess.

157
00:10:12.236 --> 00:10:14.322 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re different, Nana.

158
00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:15.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Usually, everyone says,

159
00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:18.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
"You’re mistaken.
Of course they’re worried."

160
00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:24.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it’s a fact that there are parents
who abandon their children.

161
00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:31.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A junior high student?

162
00:10:31.213 --> 00:10:34.300 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That guy who came by the store
about the bassist ad, right?

163
00:10:34.383 --> 00:10:35.968 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Didn’t he say he was eighteen?

164
00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Actually, he’s fifteen.

165
00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nana cornered him with a few questions,
and he confessed.

166
00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:42.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He told us he thought
they wouldn’t take him seriously

167
00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:44.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
if he said he was a junior high student.

168
00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:46.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, but it’s April,
so maybe he’s in tenth grade now.

169
00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:48.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although he doesn’t seem
to be going to high school.

170
00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:51.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh? Maybe he didn’t bother
taking the entrance exams.

171
00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:54.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm… I really don’t know.

172
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He doesn’t go into detail
about such things.

173
00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:58.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There seems to be more to it
under the surface.

174
00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:00.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm-hmm.

175
00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:05.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anyway, he doesn’t go home much,
so I’m somewhat concerned.

176
00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:08.709 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sure his parents are totally worried.

177
00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:11.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess so.

178
00:11:11.128 --> 00:11:13.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And we still haven’t found a drummer.

179
00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.508 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s like our luck’s running out.

180
00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:18.427 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But didn’t you say there was
a guy who tried out?

181
00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nana turned him down,
saying she didn’t like him.

182
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Although the others said
he was pretty good.

183
00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really? She must have high standards.

184
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or rather, I think she’s in love with Yasu

185
00:11:31.774 --> 00:11:33.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and therefore refuses to accept
a different drummer.

186
00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who is Yasu?

187
00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:37.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was her band’s leader back
in her hometown.

188
00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:39.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s a skinhead,
and he and Nana look so cute together.

189
00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:42.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can just imagine.

190
00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:45.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, Mr. Mizukoshi, is it okay
if I order the meat and potato dish, too?

191
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:47.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go ahead.

192
00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:50.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m so full!

193
00:11:51.001 --> 00:11:52.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is happiness!

194
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:56.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s great. But was the tavern
really okay for you?

195
00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yup! I love taverns.

196
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:00.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you for the meal.

197
00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:02.847 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana!

198
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you all right?

199
00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:08.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I might’ve had
a little too much to drink.

200
00:12:08.936 --> 00:12:10.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How embarrassing.

201
00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Oops!</i>

202
00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Well, I should be going now.
-Wait, Nana!

203
00:12:25.744 --> 00:12:28.038 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To be honest, I asked you out today

204
00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because I wanted to talk to you
about something important.

205
00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:32.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Huh? Wait a minute.</i>

206
00:12:33.502 --> 00:12:36.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ve been waiting for the right time,

207
00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:38.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I just couldn’t bring myself
to tell you.

208
00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:42.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This could come as a surprise to you.

209
00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:45.306 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
