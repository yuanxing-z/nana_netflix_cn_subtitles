00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.263 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:08:44.982 --> 00:08:47.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:53.407 --> 00:08:54.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:57.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

140
00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:59.038 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

142
00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:05.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it’s quite possible that they’ve already
found out that Nana had a roommate.

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:11.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:14.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:18.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

171
00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:42.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s like they’re taking advantage
of Ren’s scandal to promote us.

172
00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:51.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

174
00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:58.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Neither of you would answer your phone,

00:10:58.282 --> 00:10:59.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

176
00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:04.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m sorry. I had turned mine off

177
00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:06.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then did you see the broadcast?

178
00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:07.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, we saw it.

179
00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:10.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then I can get right to the point.
There’s a car waiting outside.

180
00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:12.004 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

181
00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:13.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

182
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:16.467 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just in case, you are to hide

183
00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:19.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s a good chance
reporters will come here.

184
00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:20.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

185
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

186
00:11:22.473 --> 00:11:24.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How come we’re debuting all of a sudden?

187
00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:27.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We’ll talk about it in the car.
We should hurry.

188
00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:28.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

189
00:11:28.687 --> 00:11:30.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I left Nana to Yasu.

190
00:11:31.148 --> 00:11:33.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m sure he’ll be able to deal
with the media in a professional manner.

191
00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:35.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t worry about it.

192
00:11:35.778 --> 00:11:36.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am worried!

193
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:39.907 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With all this mess going on,
Nana won’t be able to sing!

194
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.368 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is Gaia behind that show?

195
00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:45.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s the video we sent in when
we were promoting ourselves, isn’t it?

196
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:49.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But that video had been sent
to many places, right?

197
00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:52.920 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hate to say this,
but I can’t trust you, Mr. Kawano.

198
00:11:53.003 --> 00:11:55.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You keep saying things to satisfy us,
but they’ve all been lies.

199
00:11:56.257 --> 00:12:00.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t think I’m gonna be able

200
00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:06.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In fact, both Yasu and I received
blocked calls this morning

201
00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:09.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
telling us to "Watch Morning 7."

202
00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:11.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s that? A telephone threat?

203
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Whoever’s behind this,
I’m not clear what their motive is,

204
00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:17.403 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but what’s clear is
that they’re doing this

205
00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:19.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so the public will pay attention to you.

206
00:12:19.738 --> 00:12:22.950 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But who would do such a thing
other than Gaia?

207
