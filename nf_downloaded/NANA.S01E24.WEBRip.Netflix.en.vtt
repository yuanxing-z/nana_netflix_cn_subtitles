00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

<i>You know, I’m actually half-Japanese.</i>

12
00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:19.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:22.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

17
00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:24.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So our talent agency advised us
to keep it a secret,

18
00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.938 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so people would think I’m super talented

19
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:29.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in spite of me being Japanese
just like everyone else.

20
00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:36.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t care either way,
as long as I can sing.

21
00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:41.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The people around me can be pests
in other ways, too.

22
00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:45.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like they tell me not to do
or say anything that’ll hurt my image.

23
00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:49.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hurt my image or not, this is who I am.

24
00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:55.842 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Being human can be so tiring.

<i>The next day, it started raining hard</i>

26
00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:06.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>As a result, people were scarce</i>

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:10.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

29
00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:19.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you failed to go through with it.

30
00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shut up!

31
00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:26.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But even Hachi must have figured out
your feelings for her, Nobu.

32
00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She could be at a loss right now

33
00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:30.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
since you only partially confessed
your feelings to her.

34
00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:32.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What am I doing, causing her problems?

35
00:03:33.504 --> 00:03:35.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These aren’t any good.

36
00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:36.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you have a lighter?

37
00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:41.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t. Say, where did you forget
that huge lighter you had?

38
00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:44.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How do you lose something you wear
around your neck?

39
00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:47.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What am I gonna do? I really liked it too.

40
00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.730 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s a rare item,
so it's hard to find another one.

41
00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:54.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s divine punishment.
You’ve upset the Demon Lord.

42
00:03:55.526 --> 00:03:56.736 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think so?

43
00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:57.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

44
00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, Yasu.

45
00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:01.741 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Where’s Nana?
-Not here yet.

46
00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:04.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So how did it go with the record company?

47
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll tell you when Nana gets here.

48
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, you can tell us.

49
00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:08.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you talking about?

50
00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:09.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Shin.

51
00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:13.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I couldn’t reach you
on your cell since last night.

52
00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:13.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You had me worried.

53
00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:18.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m glad to see you’re alive.

54
00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:21.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Another woman. Give it a rest, would you?

55
00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s work.

56
00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:25.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t call it work!

57
00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yasu!

58
00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:29.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How did it go with the record company?

59
00:04:29.727 --> 00:04:31.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like I said, what are you talking about?

60
00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:35.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’ve been scouted?

61
00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:38.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait… Wait a minute…

62
00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:41.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Calm… Calm down…
You need to calm down, Nana!

63
00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re the one who needs to calm down.

64
00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.078 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, now calm down,

65
00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:48.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you shall tell me what happened
in the proper order.

66
00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:49.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"You shall"?

67
00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:51.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happened was,

68
00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:54.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we casually distributed demo tapes
and a video of our live concert

69
00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to various record companies.

70
00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then one of them liked
what they saw and contacted us.

71
00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:02.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gaia Records.

72
00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:07.098 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s a super famous label!
Even I know them!

73
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:09.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I guess.
Biggest in the music industry.

74
00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:10.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Will you be able to debut?

75
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:14.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, not yet. We’re not quite there yet.

76
00:05:14.897 --> 00:05:15.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Aww…

77
00:05:16.607 --> 00:05:19.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, Yasu met
with a guy from Gaia today.

78
00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He apparently wants to come
to our next concert.

79
00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:27.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we do well,
he’ll seriously consider signing us.

80
00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:30.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see. Then I’m sure things will go well.

81
00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:32.582 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The live performance of BLAST
is outta this world after all.

82
00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:35.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right? We’ve practically won this battle.

83
00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:36.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’ll be a breeze!

84
00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:39.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A breeze? You’re beaming with confidence.

85
00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:44.218 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When’s your next live concert?
The end of the month, isn’t it?

86
00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:47.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-The 28th.
-We’d better let Misato know.

87
00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:51.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We were all pumped up at practice today.

88
00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:53.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobu’s guitar strings kept snapping.

91
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You should’ve come after work today.

92
00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.785 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know… Nana…

93
00:06:09.577 --> 00:06:13.164 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yesterday… Er…
The day before yesterday? Huh?

94
00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:18.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anyway, the day
of Trapnest’s final concert.

95
00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:21.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Takumi came here late that night.

96
00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:25.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I know.
Actually, I saw you all lovey-dovey.

97
00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:28.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I called out to you,
but you didn’t even notice me.

98
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.225 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I knew it. I’m sorry.

99
00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:33.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wh-- What about?

100
00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:38.606 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That time, I wasn’t thinking clearly.
I’ll bet you were surprised.

101
00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:42.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hadn’t told you anything prior to that.

102
00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:44.403 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I was surprised,

103
00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:46.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but there’s nothing
to apologize about, is there?

104
00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:48.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Since the fact that Takumi
came to our place

105
00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:50.493 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
meant that the party was over,

106
00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:54.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I figured you had gone out to see Ren.

107
00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:57.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But then I started thinking that
you might’ve left out of courtesy to us,

108
00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:58.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I started getting concerned.

109
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, you’re wrong.

110
00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:02.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I got an email from Ren,
so I went to see him.

111
00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:04.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I see. Thank goodness.

112
00:07:04.715 --> 00:07:08.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Nana, you told me that
you won’t have Ren stay over

113
00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:10.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because I’d feel obligated
to be hospitable.

114
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll be more careful from now on, too.

115
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, never mind.

116
00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:17.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, I’m thinking of staying
at Ren’s place for a while.

117
00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Huh?
-Want a drink?

118
00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:23.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes. Or, ah…
You’re gonna stay at Ren’s place?

119
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just for the two weeks
that Trapnest has off.

120
00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He tells me they rarely get
this much time to themselves,

121
00:07:29.907 --> 00:07:31.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I thought I’d be with him
during that time.

122
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I see. Well, naturally,</i>

123
00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>of course she’d wanna be with Ren.</i>

124
00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:42.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So the same goes for you.

125
00:07:42.753 --> 00:07:44.881 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t hesitate to have Takumi
come here every day

126
00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:46.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
during that period.

127
00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He’s not likely to come here every day.

128
00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:52.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Takumi told me he’s busy
even during the days he’s off.

129
00:07:52.388 --> 00:07:55.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I guess that could be a lie.

130
00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:58.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I don’t think it’s a lie.

131
00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:01.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Since he’s normally really busy,
it’s likely that

132
00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:04.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he has a ton of non-work related stuff
to catch up on.

133
00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:07.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ren was saying something
similar to that, too.

134
00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:08.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m glad.

135
00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:12.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s gonna be all right.
He’ll be here again soon.

136
00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:17.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't think you'd cheer me on
like this.

137
00:08:18.414 --> 00:08:21.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s why I couldn’t bring myself
to tell you.

138
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I’m sorry.
-Why?

139
00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:28.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought you’d despise me.

140
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Despise you?

141
00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:32.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sleeping with my favorite musician
and stuff.

142
00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:35.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s just plain foolish,
don’t you think?

143
00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:37.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even I think it’s foolish.

144
00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:39.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you saying?

145
00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:43.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sure, Takumi may just happen
to be a successful musician,

146
00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:47.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but regardless of that fact,
you’ve fallen in love with him, right?

147
00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:49.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Regardless?</i>

148
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:50.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

149
00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:52.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I wonder.</i>

150
00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:56.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>To me, Takumi is simply</i>
<i>Takumi from Trapnest.</i>

151
00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:59.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I’ve never thought of him</i>
<i>as anything else.</i>

152
00:09:00.122 --> 00:09:02.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>When I think of him as some random guy,</i>

153
00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:04.669 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>he does seem to be</i>
<i>a really horrible person.</i>

154
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.046 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know…

155
00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:10.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can’t stand girls who’d casually sleep
with a guy like that

156
00:09:10.174 --> 00:09:13.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
just for the thrill of doing it
with a celebrity.

157
00:09:13.177 --> 00:09:15.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But how could I despise you

158
00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:20.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
after seeing you shed tears
like that in his arms?

159
00:09:21.852 --> 00:09:25.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even Takumi must’ve felt pure love for you

160
00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:28.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when he saw you cry like that
straight from your heart.

161
00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:31.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If he didn’t feel love,
he would’ve been uncomfortable.

162
00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:34.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like, "What mess did I get myself into
having a girl cry on me like this?"

163
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it’s gonna be all right.

164
00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:37.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good luck.

165
00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:47.545 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
People close to you may worry
and say things to you regarding Takumi.

166
00:09:47.628 --> 00:09:50.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yasu especially has a tendency to worry.

167
00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:51.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But don’t let it bother you.

168
00:09:51.507 --> 00:09:53.593 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which reminds me, Nana. About that…

169
00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
About what?

170
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
About me and Takumi… you know…

171
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You were saying that you saw us.

172
00:10:02.184 --> 00:10:03.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did you tell everyone about it, Nana?

173
00:10:04.645 --> 00:10:07.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry. I did tell Yasu. Is that bad?

174
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it’s not about Yasu, but rather Nobu.

175
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wonder if Yasu told him anything.

176
00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:14.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, that’s not it!

177
00:10:14.905 --> 00:10:17.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nobu and Shin heard it
from Takumi at the party.

178
00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:21.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He said that she was wagging
her tail looking all pleased.

179
00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:23.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then Nobu lost it.

180
00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:24.540 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What did you just say?

181
00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, but he didn’t mean any disrespect.

182
00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:32.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the fact that he went to see Hachi
after that is so unlike him.

183
00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:35.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He usually hates getting
into such hassle over a woman.

184
00:10:35.926 --> 00:10:38.012 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When Shin poured his drink over Takumi,

185
00:10:38.095 --> 00:10:39.972 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was sure he’d never want
anything to do with her again,

186
00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:43.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I guess he does have
feelings for Hachiko.

187
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What did Takumi tell them at the party?

188
00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:53.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It seems that he told everyone
that you two started going out.

189
00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:56.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That we’re going out?

190
00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll bet he casually
and jokingly told everyone

191
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that "I did it with her"
in that way he always acts.

192
00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:04.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>You know him well.</i>

193
00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:07.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But what was that about Nobu
that you brought up a moment ago?

194
00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:09.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did something happen with Nobu?

195
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:16.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What happened is… last night…

196
00:11:16.884 --> 00:11:19.136 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nobu suddenly showed up
and said he needed to talk to me.

197
00:11:19.762 --> 00:11:21.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He said something
about becoming better than Takumi

198
00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:23.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or something like that…

199
00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:26.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m not really sure what
that was all about, but… well…

200
00:11:26.977 --> 00:11:29.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. In other words,
he came to confess his love.

201
00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:31.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think that was what it was, too?

202
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it’s not as if he actually said that.

203
00:11:33.692 --> 00:11:35.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He probably couldn’t.

204
00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:39.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, everyone’s sort of caught on
to the fact that he’s in love with you.

205
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.829 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had no idea about that!
What am I gonna do?

206
00:11:44.912 --> 00:11:48.332 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh. So that’s why you didn’t drop
by the studio today?

207
00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:49.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well…

208
00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:51.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t worry about it.

209
00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:53.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There’s nothing you can really do

00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:00.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:34.535 --> 00:16:38.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

267
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:46.171 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:48.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.300 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:53.929 --> 00:16:57.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I do feel uneasy about accepting
100,000 for that,

273
00:16:57.224 --> 00:16:59.560 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I will spend another night with you.
