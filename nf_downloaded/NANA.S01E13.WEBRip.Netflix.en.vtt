31
00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:05.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

41
00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.806 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

42
00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:47.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

43
00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

44
00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:52.315 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s only a small publishing company,

45
00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:56.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

46
00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I even had to come in

47
00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

48
00:04:00.698 --> 00:04:04.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So much for weekends off.
I hate it. I wanna quit!

49
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Then quit.
-Don’t say it so casually!

50
00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:10.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You just said you wanted to quit.

51
00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:16.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it’s not that easy. I haven’t even
worked there for a week yet,

52
00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:20.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and if I quit, there’s no guarantee that
I’d find another job right away.

53
00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I can’t make a living unless I work.

54
00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:24.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then you have no choice.

55
00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:32.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

106
00:07:47.925 --> 00:07:51.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why is there no elevator
in this seven story building?

107
00:07:52.346 --> 00:07:55.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

108
00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:59.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This must be why the rent is so cheap.

109
00:08:00.938 --> 00:08:02.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:06.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

112
00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:08.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A live show! A live show!

113
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They had an opening
in an upcoming event at Shimokita,

114
00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:12.825 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they’re letting us
fill that spot and play.

115
00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:15.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

-It’s for thirty minutes on May 5th!

116
00:08:25.546 --> 00:08:27.298 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yay!

117
00:08:28.716 --> 00:08:31.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t cry, Hachiko!
We’re gonna party today!

118
00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:43.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, did you hear?
On May 5th, Children’s Day,

119
00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:47.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they’re gonna decorate the kids’ meals
with little carp kites.

120
00:08:47.818 --> 00:08:50.029 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at this. Cute, don’t you think?

121
00:08:50.112 --> 00:08:54.116 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wow, this is really well made!
This is great.

122
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.786 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You want it?
-Yeah, sort of.

123
00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:58.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you can’t have it.

124
00:08:58.454 --> 00:09:01.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I got it as a birthday present
from our boss.

125
00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:03.626 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? It was your birthday?

126
00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:06.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why didn’t you tell me?

127
00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:09.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, not yet.
My birthday is on Children’s Day.

128
00:09:10.341 --> 00:09:12.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I told him it’s a shame
I won’t see them being served

129
00:09:12.843 --> 00:09:15.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because I won’t be working that day,

130
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so then he gave this to me,
saying it’s a birthday present.

131
00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.727 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, so that’s why.
I’m off in the evening that day,

132
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so why don’t we spend the evening
together to celebrate?

133
00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:24.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

134
00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:29.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What do you want for your present?
A chimaki, maybe?

135
00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:30.778 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I love chimakis.

136
00:09:33.864 --> 00:09:35.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shoji, your cell phone.

137
00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:37.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, sorry. I forgot to turn it off.

138
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You should answer it.

139
00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:40.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ah, but…
-It’s from your girlfriend, right?

140
00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:43.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you keep ignoring her calls,
she’s gonna become suspicious.

141
00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:47.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I’ll step outside.
-Ah, then I’ll go out…

142
00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:54.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Damn, what am I doing? Pathetic.</i>

143
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.972 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hello?
-Oh, Shoji! You’re awake!

144
00:09:58.055 --> 00:10:01.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Guess what? The date for Nana's
band's first live show has been decided!

145
00:10:01.225 --> 00:10:04.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, r-- really? That’s great.

146
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:07.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>It’s at 8:00 p.m. on May 5th.</i>
<i>Can you make it?</i>

147
00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The 5th?

148
00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:14.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Sorry. I can’t make it on the 5th.</i>

149
00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:17.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What? You can’t? You have work?
-<i>Yeah.</i>

150
00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:20.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way. Can’t you do something about it?

151
00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:24.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>No. You know, it gets extra busy</i>
<i>on national holidays, so I’ve gotta work.</i>

152
00:10:24.373 --> 00:10:26.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I’m really sorry.</i>
<i>We’ll do it some other time.</i>

153
00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:28.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure.

154
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.642 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On Children’s Day,
let’s scatter some beans.

155
00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:45.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re thinking
of the Setsubun festivities, Shoji.

156
00:10:57.114 --> 00:11:00.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop looking. It’s so distracting.

157
00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:03.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I was thinking,
"Wow, what a good looking woman,"

158
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.163 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
then I noticed it was you.

159
00:11:04.246 --> 00:11:07.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Huh? You won’t get anything
from seducing me.

160
00:11:07.708 --> 00:11:11.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t really need anything,
as long as I have you by my side.

161
00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What’s gotten into you?
Do you have food poisoning?

162
00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:16.550 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I forgot to tell you,
the eggs in the fridge are old.

163
00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:20.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, I’ve been wondering
why people have a change of heart.

164
00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:24.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the more I think about that,
the tougher it is to take.

165
00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:25.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh?

166
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:31.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had forgotten all about Tamura
from class six until Shoji brought her up.

167
00:11:31.315 --> 00:11:32.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Tamura from class six?

168
00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:36.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unlike the other girls I went out with,
I really loved her.

169
00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:39.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it really hurt when I found out
she was only playing with me.

170
00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:44.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What bittersweet teen years.

171
00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:49.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, there’s nothing
we can do about Shoji.

172
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.253 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What do you mean?
Don’t tell me, he did it with Sachiko?

173
00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:55.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, I didn’t think
he was the kind of guy

174
00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:58.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who was capable of cheating,
due to multiple reasons.

175
00:11:58.676 --> 00:12:01.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As far as I know, neither did I!

176
00:12:03.597 --> 00:12:06.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s not just fooling around either.
He’s serious about the other girl.

177
00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:09.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s seriously fallen in love
with Sachiko.

178
00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:11.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s no longer able
to think rationally or morally.

179
00:12:12.523 --> 00:12:14.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There’s nothing we can do.

180
00:12:30.207 --> 00:12:31.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s he gonna do about Nana?

181
00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:37.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wonder. It’s not as if anything’s
happened for him to dislike Nana.

182
00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:39.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m sure he continues
to have feelings for her.

183
00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:42.178 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But he’s gotta make things clear,

184
00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
or else he’ll end up hurting
both Nana and Sachiko.

185
00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:47.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re right, but that’s
based on your values.

186
00:12:48.058 --> 00:12:51.937 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t know much about Sachiko,
but what would be best for Nana?

187
00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:54.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As long as she doesn’t find out about it,

188
00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:56.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shoji may be necessary for her,
even if he is seeing someone else.

189
00:12:56.692 --> 00:13:00.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Over time, Shoji’s feelings
for the other girl may cool.

190
00:13:00.738 --> 00:13:03.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can’t expect me
to agree with that logic.

191
00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:05.659 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But just imagine for a minute.

192
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Imagine Nana
after she gets ditched by Shoji.

193
00:13:10.664 --> 00:13:14.877 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Frightening, don’t you think?
She might even slit her wrists.

194
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just hope Shoji is doing
everything possible

195
00:13:16.754 --> 00:13:18.255 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to make sure Nana doesn’t find out!

196
00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:22.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can’t be sure. It’s really frightening.

197
00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:36.482 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello, Nana here. Oh, Jun-chan?

198
00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:39.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>It’s been a while. What’s up?</i>

199
00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:42.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, Nana?

200
00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:44.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re in the middle of work now,
aren’t you? Is it okay to talk?

201
00:13:44.114 --> 00:13:48.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mm-hmm. No problem. We met our deadline,
so things are pretty peaceful here.

202
00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:51.997 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Hey, about that email you sent me</i>
<i>regarding your roommate’s live show.</i>

203
00:13:52.081 --> 00:13:54.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, right! It’s next Saturday!
Can you come?

<i>Mm-hmm. I’ll go with Kyosuke.</i>

205
00:13:58.712 --> 00:14:00.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The three of us can go together then.

206
00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:03.342 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? The three of us? What about Shoji?

207
00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:05.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Shoji said he had to work</i>

208
00:14:05.928 --> 00:14:06.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

209
00:14:07.054 --> 00:14:11.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Hey, Jun-chan, don’t you think Shoji</i>

210
00:14:11.225 --> 00:14:13.727 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What do you mean?
-<i>I just have this feeling.</i>

211
00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:15.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You think so?
He hasn’t really changed at all.

212
00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:18.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I get the feeling
he’s been avoiding me.

213
00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:21.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>That’s not true! You’re imagining it!</i>

214
00:14:21.485 --> 00:14:24.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it seems that Shoji’s
seriously growing tired of me.

215
00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:27.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

219
00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:37.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I see. You’re right.

220
00:14:37.334 --> 00:14:40.004 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll show him that I care.
Yeah, I’ll do my best.

221
00:14:40.087 --> 00:14:42.590 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks, I’ll call you later.

222
00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:45.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come on, Ms. Sakagami.
What are you doing here wasting time?

223
00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:47.553 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please get back to work.

224
00:14:51.223 --> 00:14:55.644 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why do I have to take the fall for Shoji?
This is all wrong.

225
00:14:56.645 --> 00:14:59.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>But what else can I do?</i>

226
00:14:59.189 --> 00:15:01.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much!

227
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shoji!

228
00:15:06.697 --> 00:15:07.531 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I came.

229
00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:10.034 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry for coming here without any notice.

230
00:15:10.826 --> 00:15:13.871 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nice to meet you. I’m the bassist, Shin.

231
00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:17.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hachi wouldn’t shut up
about wanting to see you.

232
00:15:18.542 --> 00:15:20.336 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We came all the way here,
so you’re paying.

233
00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:23.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Um… Then allow me
to show you to your table.

234
00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:25.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please do.

235
00:15:26.175 --> 00:15:27.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This way, please.

236
00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:29.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No way. I’d rather sit
at that window seat over there.

237
00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:32.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why should it matter where we sit?

238
00:15:33.557 --> 00:15:34.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Welcome.

239
00:15:35.976 --> 00:15:38.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Where’d Shoji go?

240
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m sure he went
to get us water or something.

241
00:15:42.566 --> 00:15:44.193 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would you sit down already?

242
00:15:44.902 --> 00:15:48.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your boyfriend is so cool, Nana.
And that uniform really suits him.

243
00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:50.950 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Doesn’t it? Though he’s kinda lame
when he speaks.

244
00:15:52.409 --> 00:15:53.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now how many times have I heard that?

245
00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:01.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What are you doing, Ms. Kawamura?
-Excuse me! I’m very sorry!

246
00:16:01.168 --> 00:16:02.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You could hurt yourself
if you pick it up with your bare hands.

247
00:16:02.544 --> 00:16:04.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll go get a broom.

248
00:16:08.425 --> 00:16:10.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re bleeding! Are you okay?

249
00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:15.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your handkerchief. I’m sorry.

250
00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:17.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t worry about it.

251
00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:19.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You can have it, so never mind.
-But…

252
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:22.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What’s important now is
for you to treat that cut.

253
00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:28.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I’m sorry!
-Huh?

254
00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:32.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ms. Kawamura. Why are you crying?
Get a hold of yourself!

255
00:16:32.324 --> 00:16:34.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll take care of things here.
You go to the back.

256
00:16:36.578 --> 00:16:39.540 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m terribly sorry
for all the trouble, miss.

257
00:16:39.623 --> 00:16:42.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, please do not worry about me.

258
00:16:43.961 --> 00:16:46.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re so kind, Hachiko.
My impression of you has just improved.

259
00:16:47.047 --> 00:16:51.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, I used to work at
a family restaurant like this in the past,

260
00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:54.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so when I see something like that,
it’s like seeing myself.

261
00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:57.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh. I can just see you making
far worse blunders.

262
00:16:57.808 --> 00:17:01.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Huh? What’s that supposed to mean?
Come on!

263
00:17:04.231 --> 00:17:06.442 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I’ve run away again.</i>

264
00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:08.569 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What am I doing hiding like this?</i>

265
00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:11.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I should’ve predicted this much.</i>

266
00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:15.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Well, Nana might not realize,</i>
<i>but Sachiko could very well realize.</i>

267
00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:17.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Nana can be pretty loud, too.</i>

268
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Please, let Nana be nice and quiet.</i>

269
00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:31.467 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I really am pathetic. I could just puke</i>
<i>thinking about how detestable a guy I am.</i>

270
00:17:50.861 --> 00:17:51.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sachiko.

271
00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:00.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let’s put an end to this, Shoji.

272
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She’s cute, kind,
and such a wonderful girlfriend.

273
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What just happened between you and her?

274
00:18:07.294 --> 00:18:11.298 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s all right.
I doubt she has caught onto anything.

275
00:18:15.385 --> 00:18:17.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let’s put an end to this,
before she ends up getting hurt.

276
00:18:21.183 --> 00:18:22.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry, Shoji.

277
00:18:22.893 --> 00:18:28.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I hadn’t gone after you like I did,
none of this would’ve happened.

278
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s not true.

279
00:18:32.402 --> 00:18:36.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But at this rate,
I’ll just be more of a bother to you.

280
00:18:36.907 --> 00:18:37.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s not true!

281
00:18:38.826 --> 00:18:42.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This’ll continue hurting me, too.

282
00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:50.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No one can end up happy in this situation.

283
00:18:51.922 --> 00:18:55.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Make sure you take good care of her.

284
00:19:09.439 --> 00:19:12.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess it’s kinda hard to eat
with a pierced lip.

285
00:19:13.735 --> 00:19:14.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Serves you right.

286
00:19:14.903 --> 00:19:18.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shin, you seem to be getting
more piercings by the day.

287
00:19:18.907 --> 00:19:20.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now you even have one there.

288
00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:23.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What have you done to your beautiful face?

289
00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:26.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I’m sure kissing is harder with that.
-No, I had no problem with that.

290
00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:31.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shin! Who’d you kiss? Was it Nobu?

291
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Huh? Is Nobu into that sort of stuff?
-Is he?

292
00:19:35.257 --> 00:19:38.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, no. But I thought this guy might be.

293
00:19:38.802 --> 00:19:40.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m straight.

294
00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:45.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, Shin. Do you plan to continue living
at Nobu’s place like you are now?

295
00:19:45.392 --> 00:19:49.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, I haven’t been
to Nobu’s place much lately.

296
00:19:49.313 --> 00:19:50.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t wanna be a burden.

297
00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So you’ve returned home.
-Nope.

298
00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:55.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then where are you staying?

299
00:19:55.903 --> 00:19:57.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
At some women's places.

300
00:19:57.404 --> 00:19:58.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What!

301
00:19:58.906 --> 00:19:59.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I move from place to place.

302
00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way!

303
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:07.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m still fifteen, I look like this,
and I still can’t find a steady job,

304
00:20:07.331 --> 00:20:10.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I realized that if I live this way,
I won’t have any money problems.

305
00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:14.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Surprisingly, life can be pretty easy.

306
00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:20.844 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shin… You’re a natural born bastard.

307
00:20:20.928 --> 00:20:21.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
