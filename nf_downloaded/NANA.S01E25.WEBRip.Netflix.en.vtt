00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m thinking about going on a trip.

10
00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:10.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, that sounds nice.

11
00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't forget my souvenir.

12
00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:14.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m finished.

13
00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.263 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So where do you wanna go?

14
00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:19.973 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go on your own.

15
00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:22.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You might have the time, but I’m busy.

16
00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Take some time off work.

17
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have an important concert coming up,

18
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I have to practice every day.

19
00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:32.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s that? Are you on the pill again?

20
00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:34.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s your fault!
If you want a child that badly,

21
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
have some other woman
give birth to one for you.

22
00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don’t mind
if I sleep with another woman?

23
00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:41.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re such a cold woman.

24
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:43.413 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You just realized that now?

25
00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:48.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m gonna go write a song

26
00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:50.628 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for the cute Reira.

27
00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:09.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Shin. You’re awake.

28
00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:12.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good morning, Ms. Ryoko.

29
00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:16.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ll be flying out again tomorrow.
To the States.

30
00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So I won’t be seeing you for a while.

31
00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:21.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I’ll bring back a bunch of gifts,
so keep your hopes high.

32
00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:22.911 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you’ll be going.

33
00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:25.663 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll be lonely without you, Ms. Ryoko.

34
00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:28.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, my. You’re not only good
with your technique,

35
00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:30.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you’ve also improved
your choice of words.

36
00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:32.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Perhaps it’s due
to my great teaching skills.

37
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.298 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am grateful.
Thanks to you, business is thriving.

38
00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:41.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ve turned an angel into a devil.

39
00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:44.766 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Up close,

40
00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.559 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess you don’t look much
like her after all.

41
00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:48.770 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? What did you say?

42
00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:51.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. Nothing. Seconds please!

43
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yasu!

44
00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Long time no see.

45
00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.829 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You haven’t changed one bit.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

46
00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, one stout beer please.
How are you doing?

47
00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.626 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m glad to finally meet up with you.

48
00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s because you keep pestering me.

49
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.507 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I invited Reira too,
but she’s back in her hometown.

50
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She really wanted to come.

51
00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that so?

52
00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:22.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
By the way, Naoki, your voice is too loud.

53
00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:25.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’re a celebrity now,
so you’d be wise to keep a low profile.

54
00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:26.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not to worry.

55
00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The customers here are all
from the entertainment industry.

56
00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:29.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

57
00:04:29.852 --> 00:04:33.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By the way, Yasu, I heard you came
to Tokyo to go pro.

58
00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Reira was complaining that
she’s not happy with your decision.

59
00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:38.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I guessed as much.
That’s why I don’t wanna see her.

60
00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:40.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She’ll keep teasing me about it.

61
00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, of course she’d tease you.

62
00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.909 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What in the world happened
to make you change your mind?

63
00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:46.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let’s see.

64
00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:50.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You could say I feel responsible
for the band like it's my child.

65
00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:54.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What’s that supposed to mean?
You really haven’t changed, Yasu.

66
00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You need to let it all out sometimes.

67
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go wild for a change.

68
00:04:58.047 --> 00:05:01.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Though I suggest not becoming
as violent as Takumi.

69
00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:02.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When he loses it, he becomes a criminal.

70
00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:05.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Although he’s been quite calm as of late,

71
00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:06.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
perhaps from fear of becoming
the next gossip item.

72
00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:07.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Back in junior high school,

73
00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:10.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
none of the windows had
glass because of him.

74
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I remember that.

75
00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:15.982 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Speaking of Takumi,
I can’t reach him on his cell phone.

76
00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s he up to?

77
00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:18.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t know, but…

78
00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:21.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s probably visiting women,
one after another.

79
00:05:21.904 --> 00:05:23.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There’s no need to worry about him.

80
00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that so?

81
00:06:08.826 --> 00:06:10.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Reira, what are you doing?

82
00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:15.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Visiting my hometown.
-Oh right. Of course.

83
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You startled me.
How long have you been here?

84
00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:20.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thirty minutes.
-Huh?

85
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ve been here staring at you
like this for thirty minutes,

86
00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:26.260 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but you didn’t notice me at all, Takumi.

87
00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:27.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm exhausted.

88
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I meant how long
have you been in town.

89
00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:32.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anyway, if you’ve been staring at me,
the least you could do is say something!

90
00:06:33.017 --> 00:06:34.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ve been here for three days.

91
00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:37.063 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was visiting mother’s grave just now.

92
00:06:37.146 --> 00:06:40.191 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But your mother is still alive.

93
00:06:40.274 --> 00:06:42.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your mother, Takumi.

94
00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Due to work, you couldn’t be
here for the ceremony

95
00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
marking seven years after her passing,

96
00:06:46.155 --> 00:06:50.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I prayed that she may
warmly protect her careless son

97
00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:53.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
from the wrath of the gods.

98
00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:54.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, thanks for that.

99
00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:58.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is your father doing okay?
Maybe I should go and say hi.

100
00:06:58.501 --> 00:06:59.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t bother.

101
00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:01.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He’s the same as always,
drinking from early in the day.

102
00:07:02.004 --> 00:07:05.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s gotta be tough
for your elder sister and her husband.

103
00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:06.551 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With a little brother like this
on top of it.

104
00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:08.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, if you’re gonna worry
about someone,

105
00:07:08.344 --> 00:07:10.012 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
worry about your own mother!

106
00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Leaving her alone way out here
in the countryside.

107
00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:18.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But she says
she doesn’t wanna go to Tokyo.

108
00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:20.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She really likes this place.

109
00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t get it.

110
00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:27.780 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What’s so good about this place
way out in the countryside?

111
00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:30.825 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Especially given the fact
she lived in New York at one point.

112
00:07:30.908 --> 00:07:35.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Isn’t that why?
Living abroad didn’t suit her at all.

113
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ve been telling her Tokyo
isn’t a foreign country.

114
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I kinda miss New York.
It’s my birthplace after all.

115
00:07:44.755 --> 00:07:45.882 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why not go there?

116
00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:48.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Though we only have two more days off.

117
00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:50.178 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You should’ve gone.

118
00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:53.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm… But I had a number of things to do.

119
00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides, we all should pay our respects
to our parents once in a while.

120
00:07:55.933 --> 00:07:58.269 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We came so close on our tour
the other day,

121
00:07:58.352 --> 00:08:00.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I couldn’t visit because
of our tight schedule.

122
00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:01.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about you, Takumi?

123
00:08:01.772 --> 00:08:05.318 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As long as I stay in Tokyo,
I end up working.

124
00:08:05.401 --> 00:08:06.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I thought I’d wander off
to the countryside.

125
00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Call it an escape.

126
00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:12.825 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I can’t keep my mind off work,
so I’ll be returning now.

127
00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:15.786 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just stopped by here for a bit.

128
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh, you’re going back?

129
00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:21.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We got to meet here,
so why not have some fun together?

130
00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:22.752 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Give me a break.

131
00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:25.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Give me a chance to be alone
on our off days. See ya.

132
00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:35.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, Reira…

133
00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:40.937 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We’ve got a photo shoot
for a magazine next week,

134
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.104 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so don’t get tanned.

135
00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:44.774 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m aware of that, leader.

136
00:08:49.403 --> 00:08:52.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is that Takumi guy doing?

137
00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:54.408 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
His time off is coming to an end.

138
00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:56.786 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I didn’t contact him either.

139
00:08:56.869 --> 00:09:00.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why didn’t you?
You have no reason to hold back.

140
00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:03.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You should send him a bunch
of emails daily and keep his mind on you.

141
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:06.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I don’t wanna contact him
only to be ignored.

142
00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:08.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He may be in less of a position
to contact you

143
00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:09.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
once he's back to work.

144
00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:12.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. But it’s okay if that’s how it goes.

145
00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:17.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yasu! Aren’t you worried about Hachi?

146
00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:21.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t you get the urge to call Takumi
and give him an earful?

147
00:09:21.143 --> 00:09:24.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sure. But I can’t get through
to him on his cell.

148
00:09:24.438 --> 00:09:27.942 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nana! If he came to see me
because someone around him told him to,

149
00:09:28.025 --> 00:09:29.277 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that’s not gonna make me too happy!

150
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really am fine, so don’t worry!

151
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>The way I said that…</i>

152
00:09:36.158 --> 00:09:39.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

<i>I’m trying to be strong about this.</i>

153
00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:41.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>But the honest truth is,</i>

154
00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:46.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>if Takumi were to never call me again,</i>
<i>I’d be fine with that.</i>

155
00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:50.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Or in fact, it would be better that way.</i>

156
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hachi! Buy one for me too!

157
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:54.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Buy it yourself.

158
00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:57.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What should I get?

159
00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, Nana’s singing seems
to be improving day by day,

160
00:10:45.686 --> 00:10:47.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

161
00:10:47.688 --> 00:10:48.898 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maybe because of the sit-ups.

162
00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sure we'd be able to go pro, right?

163

177
00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:48.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll be fine on my own from here on.

178
00:11:48.916 --> 00:11:50.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

193
