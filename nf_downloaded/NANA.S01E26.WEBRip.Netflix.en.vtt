00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:10.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
BLAST is really popular!

8
00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:13.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The line was all the way
to the convenience store.

12
00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.104 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was the right decision to come early.

13
00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:29.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You might wanna tell
Junko and Kyosuke to hurry.

14
00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:32.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Jun-chan was a bit pissed off
at the concert the other day,

15
00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:34.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

16
00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:36.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She said she would watch
from the back today.

17
00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:38.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t push! I’m dying here!

18
00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:39.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ouch!

19
00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:42.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Huh? Why? That life-risking feeling
is what makes it so special!

20
00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:48.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It never gets that heated
at the concerts back home.

21
00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:52.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was so excited that I almost passed out.

22
00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Almost passed out?

23
00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:58.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>It was only their third concert,</i>

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:01.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

25
00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:04.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

26
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Awesome! Awesome! Super awesome!

27
00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:09.731 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Jun-chan and Kyosuke might not
be able to get in.

28
00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:12.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? Tickets are sold out?

29
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:14.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow. Incredible.

30
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We’re all standing anyway.
Can’t you squeeze in just two more?

31
00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:19.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we’re already way past capacity.

32
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:22.619 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I beg you.
Our friends are performing at seven.

33
00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.121 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your friends? Are you on the guest list?

34
00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:26.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I dunno.
-Your names?

35
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:28.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Saotome and Takakura.

36
00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:31.669 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s fine. Go ahead.

37
00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:33.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you don’t mind standing
in the hallway way up in the back.

38
00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:36.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hey, do you have tickets?
-No.

39
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then give up. The show is sold out.

40
00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:40.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-What?

41
00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:45.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No way! We came all the way out
to Tokyo just to come to this concert!

42
00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:47.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See? I told you we should’ve left earlier.

43
00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:50.188 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s your fault for insisting
on attending those classes!

44
00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:52.315 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the teacher said he wouldn’t
let me graduate high school

45
00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:53.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
unless I attended those classes!

46
00:03:53.691 --> 00:03:55.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, that’s your fault
for not studying hard enough!

47
00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:58.947 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I beg of you, please let us in!

48
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Impossible! Any more people
and we’d be facing safety issues!

49
00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:03.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Some concert isn’t worth
losing your life over!

50
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:06.162 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It sure is!
-Like I said, it’s impossible.

51
00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nana! Nana!

52
00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:09.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Crying isn’t gonna help.

53
00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:15.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Listen… Let these girls go in
instead of us.

54
00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>The enthusiasm of the crowd increased</i>

55
00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I started feeling dizzy from it.</i>

56
00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I’m sorry.

57
00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:26.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s okay.

58
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:28.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Excuse me.

59
00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:31.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But thank goodness we got in, Akiko.

60
00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fortunately, our expensive
plane tickets didn't go to waste.

61
00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:36.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Say, the people of Tokyo
are surprisingly kind.

62
00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wish we could get down there.

63
00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:41.531 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But even the stairway is packed
with people, so I guess it’s impossible.

64
00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:42.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But this is nice.

65
00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:45.785 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can see better from here,
and we don’t have to risk our lives.

66
00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:47.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anyway, what’s up with all
these people right from the beginning?

67
00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:48.871 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Impressive, huh?

68
00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s because they’re good.

69
00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:52.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This makes me feel lonely,
in a strange way.

70
00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:55.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
With this popularity,
Nana may have forgotten about us.

71
00:04:55.753 --> 00:04:59.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But she sent us a postcard to notify us
of her upcoming concert.

72
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That was a good call to hand her
that paper with your address on it.

73
00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.762 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, next time,
I say we skip school and work

74
00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:06.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and come to all the concerts,

75
00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:07.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
even if we have to hitchhike!

76
00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I agree! Even if we need to camp out!

77
00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:15.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’ll give us the strength
to work hard with other stuff.

Good evening. We’re BLAST.

83
00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:54.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

84
00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:57.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, I can hear it. They sure play loud!

85
00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wanna go in!

86
00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:01.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
BLAST should play in a bigger place!

87
00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.571 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you know what the population
of Tokyo is?

88
00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:09.911 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We should have purchased
tickets ahead of time.

89
00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:11.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We’ll wait and catch them
on their way out.

90
00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:13.539 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Who do you wanna see?
-Yasu.

91
00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:14.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He has great technique.

92
00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:17.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way! Yasu’s mine!

93
00:06:17.668 --> 00:06:19.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m guessing since it’s summer vacation,

94
00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:21.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so many people have come out here
from the suburbs,

95
00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:22.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
causing this situation.

96
00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:25.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even so, this level
of enthusiasm is crazy.

97
00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:26.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is this?

98
00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:28.638 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you wanna do?

99
00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:30.973 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wanna go for a coffee
until the concert’s over?

100
00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:33.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure. We’ve come all the way here.

101
00:06:33.392 --> 00:06:34.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let’s stick around and meet up
with Nana later.

102
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But with so many followers,

103
00:06:38.397 --> 00:06:39.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they should be able to go pro
without any problem.

104
00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:41.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s it! Their followers!

105
00:06:41.442 --> 00:06:46.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Misato’s one, and Nana has a bit
of that towards her roommate.

106
00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:47.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, you’re right.

107
00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:50.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe the reason she no longer
talks about the Demon Lord

108
00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:51.911 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is not because she’s matured,

109
00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:54.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but because she’s switched over
to the BLAST religion.

110
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bottom line, she needs something
to depend on.

111
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:57.959 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, at least she’s more positive now

112
00:06:58.042 --> 00:07:00.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
than back when she’d blame everything
on the Demon Lord.

113
00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:04.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Besides, BLAST is really cool.

114
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.467 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can see why they have
such devoted followers.

115
00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:09.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Their presence on stage is
out of the ordinary.

116
00:07:09.178 --> 00:07:12.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re right. Especially that vocalist.

117
00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:19.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, I was thinking.

118
00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:23.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know how with musicians,
talent alone doesn’t guarantee success?

119
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course you’ve gotta
be above a certain level

120
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
if you’re gonna go pro.

121
00:07:29.323 --> 00:07:33.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But from that point on, it’s not really
about how good or bad you are.

122
00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:40.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Charisma.

125
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:48.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:56.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I haven’t been so moved
to this extent for ages.

129
00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:00.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There’s a lot for us to discuss.

130
00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:02.064 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Rather than just talk things over here,
why don’t I…

131
00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
take you out for sushi?

132
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yay! Sushi!

133
00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:09.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shin.

134
00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:16.662 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? You didn’t go meet them backstage?

135
00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:18.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. They were seeing a guy
from a record company.

136
00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:20.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It would be distracting
to have outsiders there

137
00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:21.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
while they’re discussing business.

138
00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:23.419 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We’ll be seeing everyone
at home later, anyway.

139
00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:24.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, an after party?

140
00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:27.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then we’re going straight
to your place, Nana?

141
00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:30.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mm-hmm… I figured tonight will be
a night to celebrate,

142
00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:32.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I prepared lots of food.

143
00:08:32.386 --> 00:08:33.888 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So please come.

144
00:08:33.971 --> 00:08:35.806 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, Nana.

145
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We’re kind of busy now.

146
00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:39.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

148
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel sorry that
you couldn’t see the concert

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:01.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

155
00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:04.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s not as bad as those who came
all the way to Tokyo from a different city

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:07.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

315
00:18:03.957 --> 00:18:05.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah…

316
00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:08.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ms. Hachiko went out a short while ago.

317
00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:11.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Huh? Where could she have gone
at this hour?

318
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m not sure,
but she suddenly left in a flurry,

319
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.012 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
saying she wouldn’t be returning tonight.

320
00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:24.228 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I might’ve done something
to upset her again.

321
00:18:24.311 --> 00:18:26.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it’s not that. I’m sure it’s a guy.

322
00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:28.982 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ll bet she went to see her boyfriend.

323
00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:30.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don’t worry.
-Huh?

324
00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:32.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Is the beer cold?
-Yes.

325
00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:36.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So Ms. Hachiko has a boyfriend?

326
00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:39.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why? Does it surprise you?

327
00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:40.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes!

328
00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:41.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Yes," she says.

329
00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:45.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because to me, it seemed that
Ms. Hachiko thinks only of you, Nana.

330
00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:48.877 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There’s no way.

331
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:51.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I think only of you, Nana.

332
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Making remarks like that as
if it were impossible hurts my feelings.

333
00:18:55.843 --> 00:18:58.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry.

334
00:18:59.596 --> 00:19:01.098 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What’s this?

335
00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:02.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, it’s a microwave.

336
00:19:02.683 --> 00:19:04.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I can tell that
by looking at it, but…

337
00:19:04.518 --> 00:19:06.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She said she got a loan to buy it.

338
00:19:06.687 --> 00:19:08.981 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Apparently, that was the only place
she could put it.

339
00:19:09.064 --> 00:19:11.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If she had that kind of money,
why not get an air conditioner?

340
00:19:11.775 --> 00:19:14.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Geez, that Hachi.

341
00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:29.126 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Say, what’s with this mountain
of leftovers in the fridge?

342
00:19:30.043 --> 00:19:35.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That… Actually, Ms. Hachiko figured
tonight would be a night to celebrate,

343
00:19:35.924 --> 00:19:39.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and she had already prepared this
before I arrived here.

344
00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:42.181 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Did you already make preparations</i>
<i>for our after-party?</i>

345
00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:45.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>No, not yet. Don’t worry about us and go.</i>

346
00:19:50.731 --> 00:19:51.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sorry.

347
00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:54.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, you couldn’t help it, Nana.

348
00:19:54.818 --> 00:19:57.529 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Um, so how did it go
with the record company?

349
00:20:16.256 --> 00:20:17.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Hey, Nana…</i>

350
00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:21.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>For instance, if we were lovers,</i>

351
00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:26.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>would we have been able to fill</i>
<i>the gap between us with a hug?</i>

352
00:20:31.271 --> 00:20:37.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Or… does everyone endure this loneliness?</i>

353
00:20:57.506 --> 00:21:00.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>It’s not that I wanted</i>
<i>to keep you all to myself, Nana.</i>

354
00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:04.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I just wanted to be needed by you.</i>
