00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:47.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>What’s that supposed to mean?</i>

5
00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:53.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You went to Nana’s place
because you were worried, right?

6
00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:55.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then what good will lecturing her do?

7
00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it just came out that way.

8
00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:01.663 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How can you say things so bluntly
to someone whose heart’s been shattered?

9
00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:03.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I did it for Nana’s sake.

10
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If so, you could’ve chosen a better time.

11
00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:08.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But there’s meaning in talking to her
about it now after what happened.

12
00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:09.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Welcome.

13
00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:13.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? Hey Nobu, where’s Koichi Sato?

14
00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:15.969 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He caught a cold, so he’s off today.

15
00:02:16.052 --> 00:02:18.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really? I guess, with the change
in temperature lately…

16
00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:22.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Could we have two beers?
-Sure.

17
00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:25.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you doing
sneaking around like that, Shoji?

18
00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:31.985 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don’t worry about me. My character
disappeared in the last episode.

19
00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:33.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You definitely didn’t disappear.

20
00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:35.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I can see you just fine.
-That’s not possible…

21
00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:37.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Drink with us.
-Watch it!

22
00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:38.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How naive of you.

23
00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:41.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You deserve to experience being
that character who gets hated

24
00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:44.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and despised by viewers
but still needs to make appearances.

25
00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:48.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>I shouldn’t have come to Jackson’s.</i>

26
00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:50.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about work? Do you have the day off?

27
00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:51.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, sir. If you must know,

28
00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:53.590 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have the evenings off during
the "Golden Week" holidays.

29
00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just talk normally.

30
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I went to see Nana.

31
00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:00.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She really hates you,

32
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:03.641 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so I suggest you don’t try to fix things
and just keep a low profile.

33
00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:07.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you mean by "fix things"?

34
00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:09.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, because Shoji says

35
00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:14.277 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he hates breaking up like this
and wants to talk things over with Nana.

36
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What does he want to talk to her about?
-Some excuses, perhaps?

37
00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it’s not like I wanna make excuses…

38
00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:26.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s just, I think
I should properly apologize to her.

39
00:03:26.497 --> 00:03:27.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not a good idea!

40
00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:29.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you have no intention
of getting back together with Nana,

41
00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you should clearly end this relationship!

42
00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.171 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’ve gotta realize it’s your attitude,
trying to hold on to them both,

43
00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:35.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that hurt both Nana and Sachiko.

44
00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:37.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You still haven’t learned your lesson!

45
00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:42.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t think you wanna apologize
to Nana out of kindness.

46
00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:48.061 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
By apologizing,
you just wanna feel better about yourself.

47
00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:52.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kyosuke, you’re being just as blunt,
you know.

48
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah? It’s ok.

49
00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:58.571 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My motto is to be kind to women,
strict towards men.

50
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nobu, I’ll leave the money here.

51
00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:06.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You running away?
-No. You’re absolutely right.

52
00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:09.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So on that note, I’m gonna disappear.
-Where to?

53
00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:11.501 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are those flowers?

54
00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don’t worry about it. Bye.

55
00:04:13.544 --> 00:04:15.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Oh, Shoji!
-What?

56
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Please, just let me leave.</i>

57
00:04:17.548 --> 00:04:19.592 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That hat belongs to the store.

58
00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:24.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much.

59
00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:26.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was lame.

60
00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:33.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Apparently,
it’s his girlfriend’s birthday.

61
00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:36.734 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sachiko’s? Oh, so that’s
what the flowers were for.

62
00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:41.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was saying she’s working now,
but it’ll be her birthday at midnight,

63
00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:44.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so he wanted to be the first
to wish her a happy birthday.

64
00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That kid’s got a kind heart.

65
00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:51.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, well. He’s being all lovey-dovey
where we can’t see him.

66
00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:53.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good for him.

67
00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:57.171 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That’s how it should be,
for Sachiko’s sake.

68
00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, hello.

69
00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:05.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The main issue is with Nana,
especially with you lecturing her.

70
00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:06.973 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I just hope she’s still alive.

71
00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:10.018 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She’ll be fine! Tomorrow’s the day
of her roommate’s live concert.

72
00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She was really looking forward to that,
so she’ll be alive until then.

73
00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:15.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides, I promised her that
we’d drive her there in the evening.

74
00:05:15.356 --> 00:05:18.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But she might die after that.

75
00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:21.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Farewell.

76
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:26.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then that’ll probably also mean
the end of this series.

77
00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:31.289 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I was so thrilled that
I started crying!

78
00:05:31.372 --> 00:05:32.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It’s the first row!

79
00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:35.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The first row at a Trapnest concert!

80
00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:38.004 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I get to see Takumi in person
from that close!

81
00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:40.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I feel so great I could just die!

82
00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:41.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Farewell…</i>

83
00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:45.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I can’t do that.
If I die, I can’t see him.

84
00:05:45.386 --> 00:05:47.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So there’s no way I can die until then.

85
00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:49.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Thank goodness for that.
-Thank goodness for that.

86
00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:51.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, if by any chance
Nana can’t come along,

87
00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:52.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you wanna come with me, Jun-chan?

88
00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:58.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well… even in the front row,
I’m not particularly a fan of Trapnest.

89
00:05:58.232 --> 00:06:01.069 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why not go? It’s just a live concert.

90
00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:02.361 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s no fun.

91
00:06:03.654 --> 00:06:05.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s exactly what Nana said.

92
00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:08.034 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She says "I’ll come if I’m in the mood",

93
00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:11.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then learning that the concert hall’s
far away, she says, "That’s such a drag."

94
00:06:11.412 --> 00:06:14.207 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Far? Where exactly is it?
-At the Idea Hall.

95
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Idea Hall? You mean that place back home?
-Mm-hmm!

96
00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:22.090 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What? Why didn’t you get
tickets to the Tokyo performance?

97
00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:24.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because back when I ordered them,

98
00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:26.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I still wasn’t sure
if I’d be able to come to Tokyo.

99
00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On top of that,
given the popularity of Trapnest,

100
00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:31.516 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
even fan club members have a hard time
getting tickets for the Tokyo concert.

101
00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It would be totally sad
if I couldn’t get seats.

102
00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:37.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I was sure I could get two tickets
for the concert back home.

00:06:37.688 --> 00:06:40.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I figured I’d see them better than
from seats in Tokyo’s bigger concert hall.

104
00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m not going! It would be such a drag.

105
00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How come? You could also visit your folks,

106
00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:46.322 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so you’d be killing two birds
with one stone.

107
00:06:46.405 --> 00:06:48.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t wanna visit my folks!

108
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:51.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They’d only put me to work
in those rice fields!

109
00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:55.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fine, then. I’ll ask Nana again.

110
00:06:55.706 --> 00:06:58.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She may talk in an unfriendly tone,
but inside, she’s really kind.

111
00:06:58.417 --> 00:07:00.253 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m sure she’ll agree to come.

112
00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:03.881 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, I’d think twice
about pressuring her to go.

113
00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:07.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why not find a guy who’s a Trapnest fan
and go with him?

114
00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:08.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

115
00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:11.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You’ll have a new boyfriend,
and you get to go to the concert.

116
00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:14.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s killing two birds with one stone.

117
00:07:14.725 --> 00:07:19.730 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t want a boyfriend.
I’m through with love.

119
00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:31.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

124

132
00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:21.501 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No way, it’s a full house!

133
00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:25.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

We should’ve come sooner!

134
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What kind of event is this, anyway?
"Punk Night"?

135
00:08:30.718 --> 00:08:34.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

136
00:08:34.096 --> 00:08:39.018 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think Nana’s band is after this one!
I’m gonna force my way to the front!

137
00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:41.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, Nana, do you want a drink?

138
00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t want one!
It’ll only get in the way!

139
00:08:49.153 --> 00:08:50.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

148
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Black Stones"? Don’t know them.

149
00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.891 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"BLAST" for short? How lame.

Let’s go outside for a smoke.

152
00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:23.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The main guys have already performed.
Let’s go home!

153
00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

The next band is super cool!

156
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

157
00:09:48.462 --> 00:09:51.882 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

159
00:09:55.052 --> 00:10:00.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Especially the vocalist, Nana!
She’s so powerful for a young woman!

160
00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:02.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

161
00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:05.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, no. The vocalist is a woman,

162
00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:08.024 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the drummer and guitarist
play like pros.

163
00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:09.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is their first concert in Tokyo,

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:12.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but they were quite famous
back in their hometown.

165
00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:15.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

167
00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:20.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I hear the next band is pretty good.

170
00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:26.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

171
00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:28.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

172
00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:32.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, they’re saying that the next band’s
really great. Let’s hear them play.

173
00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:34.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:20.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

not for its looks but for its sound.

00:13:08.704 --> 00:13:09.914 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Oh, we don’t have enough plates.
Just serve it like that.

-A vinegar dish and salad.

212
00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:52.248 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

244
00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:21.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

248
00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:32.556 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’ve booked a room in a hotel
